A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are
correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of
the life of Muad'Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born
in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special
care that you locate Muad'Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be
deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen
years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.
-from "Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
In the week before their departure to Arrakis, when all the final scurrying
about had reached a nearly unbearable frenzy, an old crone came to visit the
mother of the boy, Paul.
It was a warm night at Castle Caladan, and the ancient pile of stone that
had served the Atreides family as home for twenty-six generations bore that
cooled-sweat feeling it acquired before a change in the weather.
The old woman was let in by the side door down the vaulted passage by Paul's
room and she was allowed a moment to peer in at him where he lay in his bed.
By the half-light of a suspensor lamp, dimmed and hanging near the floor,
the awakened boy could see a bulky female shape at his door, standing one step
ahead of his mother. The old woman was a witch shadow -- hair like matted
spiderwebs, hooded 'round darkness of features, eyes like glittering jewels.
"Is he not small for his age, Jessica?" the old woman asked. Her voice
wheezed and twanged like an untuned baliset.
Paul's mother answered in her soft contralto: "The Atreides are known to
start late getting their growth, Your Reverence."
"So I've heard, so I've heard," wheezed the old woman. "Yet he's already
fifteen."
"Yes, Your Reverence."
"He's awake and listening to us," said the old woman. "Sly little rascal."
She chuckled. "But royalty has need of slyness. And if he's really the Kwisatz
Haderach . . . well . . ."
Within the shadows of his bed, Paul held his eyes open to mere slits. Two
bird-bright ovals -- the eyes of the old woman -- seemed to expand and glow as
they stared into his.

"Sleep well, you sly little rascal," said the old woman. "Tomorrow you'll
need all your faculties to meet my gom jabbar."
And she was gone, pushing his mother out, closing the door with a solid
thump.
Paul lay awake wondering: What's a gom jabbar?
In all the upset during this time of change, the old woman was the strangest
thing he had seen.
Your Reverence.
And the way she called his mother Jessica like a common serving wench
instead of what she was -- a Bene Gesserit Lady, a duke's concubine and mother
of the ducal heir.
Is a gom jabbar something of Arrakis I must know before we go there? he
wondered.
He mouthed her strange words: Gom jabbar . . . Kwisatz Haderach.
There had been so many things to learn. Arrakis would be a place so
different from Caladan that Paul's mind whirled with the new knowledge. Arrakis
-- Dune -- Desert Planet.
Thufir Hawat, his father's Master of Assassins, had explained it: their
mortal enemies, the Harkonnens, had been on Arrakis eighty years, holding the
planet in quasi-fief under a CHOAM Company contract to mine the geriatric spice,
melange. Now the Harkonnens were leaving to be replaced by the House of Atreides
in fief-complete -- an apparent victory for the Duke Leto. Yet, Hawat had said,
this appearance contained the deadliest peril, for the Duke Leto was popular
among the Great Houses of the Landsraad.
"A popular man arouses the jealousy of the powerful," Hawat had said.
Arrakis -- Dune -- Desert Planet.
Paul fell asleep to dream of an Arrakeen cavern, silent people all around
him moving in the dim light of glowglobes. It was solemn there and like a
cathedral as he listened to a faint sound -- the drip-drip-drip of water. Even
while he remained in the dream, Paul knew he would remember it upon awakening.
He always remembered the dreams that were predictions.
The dream faded.
Paul awoke to feel himself in the warmth of his bed -- thinking . . .
thinking. This world of Castle Caladan, without play or companions his own age,
perhaps did not deserve sadness in farewell. Dr. Yueh, his teacher, had hinted
that the faufreluches class system was not rigidly guarded on Arrakis. The
planet sheltered people who lived at the desert edge without caid or bashar to
command them: will-o'-the-sand people called Fremen, marked down on no census of
the Imperial Regate.
Arrakis -- Dune -- Desert Planet.
Paul sensed his own tensions, decided to practice one of the mind-body
lessons his mother had taught him. Three quick breaths triggered the responses:
he fell into the floating awareness . . . focusing the consciousness . . .
aortal dilation . . . avoiding the unfocused mechanism of consciousness . . . to
be conscious by choice . . . blood enriched and swift-flooding the overload
regions . . . one does not obtain food-safety-freedom by instinct alone . . .
animal consciousness does not extend beyond the given moment nor into the idea
that its victims may become extinct . . . the animal destroys and does not
produce . . . animal pleasures remain close to sensation levels and avoid the
perceptual . . . the human requires a background grid through which to see his
universe . . . focused consciousness by choice, this forms your grid . . .
bodily integrity follows nerve-blood flow according to the deepest awareness of
cell needs . . . all things/cells/beings are impermanent . . . strive for flowpermanence within . . .
Over and over and over within Paul's floating awareness the lesson rolled.

When dawn touched Paul's window sill with yellow light, he sensed it through
closed eyelids, opened them, hearing then the renewed bustle and hurry in the
castle, seeing the familiar patterned beams of his bedroom ceiling.
The hall door opened and his mother peered in, hair like shaded bronze held
with a black ribbon at the crown, her oval face emotionless and green eyes
staring solemnly.
"You're awake," she said. "Did you sleep well?"
"Yes."
He studied the tallness of her, saw the hint of tension in her shoulders as
she chose clothing for him from the closet racks. Another might have missed the
tension, but she had trained him in the Bene Gesserit Way -- in the minutiae of
observation. She turned, holding a semiformal jacket for him. It carried the red
Atreides hawk crest above the breast pocket.
"Hurry and dress," she said. "Reverend Mother is waiting."
"I dreamed of her once," Paul said. "Who is she?"
"She was my teacher at the Bene Gesserit school. Now, she's the Emperor's
Truthsayer. And Paul . . . " She hesitated. "You must tell her about your
dreams."
"I will. Is she the reason we got Arrakis?"
"We did not get Arrakis." Jessica flicked dust from a pair of trousers, hung
them with the jacket on the dressing stand beside his bed. "Don't keep Reverend
Mother waiting."
Paul sat up, hugged his knees. "What's a gom jabbar?"
Again, the training she had given him exposed her almost invisible
hesitation, a nervous betrayal he felt as fear.
Jessica crossed to the window, flung wide the draperies, stared across the
river orchards toward Mount Syubi. "You'll learn about . . . the gom jabbar soon
enough," she said.
He heard the fear in her voice and wondered at it.
Jessica spoke without turning. "Reverend Mother is waiting in my morning
room. Please hurry."
The Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam sat in a tapestried chair watching
mother and son approach. Windows on each side of her overlooked the curving
southern bend of the river and the green farmlands of the Atreides family
holding, but the Reverend Mother ignored the view. She was feeling her age this
morning, more than a little petulant. She blamed it on space travel and
association with that abominable Spacing Guild and its secretive ways. But here
was a mission that required personal attention from a Bene Gesserit-with-theSight. Even the Padishah Emperor's Truthsayer couldn't evade that responsibility
when the duty call came.
Damn that Jessica! the Reverend Mother thought. If only she 'd borne us a
girl as she was ordered to do!
Jessica stopped three paces from the chair, dropped a small curtsy, a gentle
flick of left hand along the line of her skirt. Paul gave the short bow his
dancing master had taught -- the one used "when in doubt of another's station."
The nuances of Paul's greeting were not lost on the Reverend Mother. She
said: "He's a cautious one, Jessica."
Jessica's hand went to Paul's shoulder, tightened there. For a heartbeat,
fear pulsed through her palm. Then she had herself under control. "Thus he has
been taught, Your Reverence."
What does she fear? Paul wondered.
The old woman studied Paul in one gestalten flicker: face oval like
Jessica's, but strong bones . . . hair: the Duke's black-black but with browline
of the maternal grandfather who cannot be named, and that thin, disdainful nose;
shape of directly staring green eyes: like the old Duke, the paternal
grandfather who is dead.

Now, there was a man who appreciated the power of bravura -- even in death,
the Reverend Mother thought.
"Teaching is one thing," she said, "the basic ingredient is another. We
shall see." The old eyes darted a hard glance at Jessica. "Leave us. I enjoin
you to practice the meditation of peace."
Jessica took her hand from Paul's shoulder. "Your Reverence, I --"
"Jessica, you know it must be done."
Paul looked up at his mother, puzzled.
Jessica straightened. "Yes . . . of course."
Paul looked back at the Reverend Mother. Politeness and his mother's obvious
awe of this old woman argued caution. Yet he felt an angry apprehension at the
fear he sensed radiating from his mother.
"Paul . . . " Jessica took a deep breath. ". . . this test you're about to
receive . . . it's important to me."
"Test?" He looked up at her.
"Remember that you're a duke's son, "Jessica said. She whirled and strode
from the room in a dry swishing of skirt. The door closed solidly behind her.
Paul faced the old woman, holding anger in check. "Does one dismiss the Lady
Jessica as though she were a serving wench?"
A smile flicked the corners of the wrinkled old mouth. "The Lady Jessica was
my serving wench, lad, for fourteen years at school." She nodded. "And a good
one, too. Now, you come here!"
The command whipped out at him. Paul found himself obeying before he could
think about it. Using the Voice on me, he thought. He stopped at her gesture,
standing beside her knees.
"See this?" she asked. From the folds of her gown, she lifted a green metal
cube about fifteen centimeters on a side. She turned it and Paul saw that one
side was open -- black and oddly frightening. No light penetrated that open
blackness.
"Put your right hand in the box," she said.
Fear shot through Paul. He started to back away, but the old woman said: "Is
this how you obey your mother?"
He looked up into bird-bright eyes.
Slowly, feeling the compulsions and unable to inhibit them, Paul put his
hand into the box. He felt first a sense of cold as the blackness closed around
his hand, then slick metal against his fingers and a prickling as though his
hand were asleep.
A predatory look filled the old woman's features. She lifted her right hand
away from the box and poised the hand close to the side of Paul's neck. He saw a
glint of metal there and started to turn toward
"Stop!" she snapped.
Using the Voice again! He swung his attention back to her face.
"I hold at your neck the gom jabbar," she said. "The gom jabbar, the highhanded enemy. It's a needle with a drop of poison on its tip. Ah-ah! Don't pull
away or you'll feel that poison."
Paul tried to swallow in a dry throat. He could not take his attention from
the seamed old face, the glistening eyes, the pale gums around silvery metal
teeth that flashed as she spoke.
"A duke's son must know about poisons," she said. "It's the way of our
times, eh? Musky, to be poisoned in your drink. Aumas, to be poisoned in your
food. The quick ones and the slow ones and the ones in between. Here's a new one
for you: the gom jabbar. It kills only animals."
Pride overcame Paul's fear. "You dare suggest a duke's son is an animal?" he
demanded.
"Let us say I suggest you may be human," she said. "Steady! I warn you not
to try jerking away. I am old, but my hand can drive this needle into your neck
before you escape me."
"Who are you?" he whispered. "How did you trick my mother into leaving me
alone with you? Are you from the Harkonnens?"
"The Harkonnens? Bless us, no! Now, be silent." A dry finger touched his
neck and he stilled the involuntary urge to leap away.
"Good," she said. "You pass the first test. Now, here's the way of the rest
of it: If you withdraw your hand from the box you die. This is the only rule.
Keep your hand in the box and live. Withdraw it and die."
Paul took a deep breath to still his trembling. "If I call out there'll be
servants on you in seconds and you'll die."
"Servants will not pass your mother who stands guard outside that door.
Depend on it. Your mother survived this test. Now it's your turn. Be honored. We
seldom administer this to men-children."
Curiosity reduced Paul's fear to a manageable level. He heard truth in the
old woman's voice, no denying it. If his mother stood guard out there . . . if
this were truly a test . . . And whatever it was, he knew himself caught in it,
trapped by that hand at his neck: the gom jabbar. He recalled the response from
the Litany against Fear as his mother had taught him out of the Bene Gesserit
rite.
"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that
brings total obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me
and through me. And when it has gone past I will turn the inner eye to see its
path. Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."
He felt calmness return, said: "Get on with it, old woman."
"Old woman!" she snapped. "You've courage, and that can't be denied. Well,
we shall see, sirra." She bent close, lowered her voice almost to a whisper.
"You will feel pain in this hand within the box. Pain. But! Withdraw the hand
and I'll touch your neck with my gom jabbar -- the death so swift it's like the
fall of the headsman's axe. Withdraw your hand and the gom jabbar takes you.
Understand?"
"What's in the box?"
"Pain."
He felt increased tingling in his hand, pressed his lips tightly together.
How could this be a test? he wondered. The tingling became an itch.
The old woman said; "You've heard of animals chewing off a leg to escape a
trap? There's an animal kind of trick. A human would remain in the trap, endure
the pain, feigning death that he might kill the trapper and remove a threat to
his kind."
The itch became the faintest burning. "Why are you doing this?" he demanded.
"To determine if you're human. Be silent."
Paul clenched his left hand into a fist as the burning sensation increased
in the other hand. It mounted slowly: heat upon heat upon heat . . . upon heat.
He felt the fingernails of his free hand biting the palm. He tried to flex the
fingers of the burning hand, but couldn't move them.
"It burns," he whispered.
"Silence!"
Pain throbbed up his arm. Sweat stood out on his forehead. Every fiber cried
out to withdraw the hand from that burning pit . . . but . . . the gom jabbar.
Without turning his head, he tried to move his eyes to see that terrible needle
poised beside his neck. He sensed that he was breathing in gasps, tried to slow
his breaths and couldn't.
Pain!
His world emptied of everything except that hand immersed in agony, the
ancient face inches away staring at him.
His lips were so dry he had difficulty separating them.
The burning! The burning!
He thought he could feel skin curling black on that agonized hand, the flesh
crisping and dropping away until only charred bones remained.

It stopped!
As though a switch had been turned off, the pain stopped.
Paul felt his right arm trembling, felt sweat bathing his body.
"Enough," the old woman muttered. "Kull wahad! No woman child ever withstood
that much. I must've wanted you to fail." She leaned back, withdrawing the gom
jabbar from the side of his neck. "Take your hand from the box, young human, and
look at it."
He fought down an aching shiver, stared at the lightless void where his hand
seemed to remain of its own volition. Memory of pain inhibited every movement.
Reason told him he would withdraw a blackened stump from that box.
"Do it!" she snapped.
He jerked his hand from the box, stared at it astonished. Not a mark. No
sign of agony on the flesh. He held up the hand, turned it, flexed the fingers.
"Pain by nerve induction," she said. "Can't go around maiming potential
humans. There're those who'd give a pretty for the secret of this box, though."
She slipped it into the folds of her gown.
"But the pain --" he said.
"Pain," she sniffed. "A human can override any nerve in the body."
Paul felt his left hand aching, uncurled the clenched fingers, looked at
four bloody marks where fingernails had bitten his palm. He dropped the hand to
his side, looked at the old woman. "You did that to my mother once?"
"Ever sift sand through a screen?" she asked.
The tangential slash of her question shocked his mind into a higher
awareness: Sand through a screen, he nodded.
"We Bene Gesserit sift people to find the humans."
He lifted his right hand, willing the memory of the pain. "And that's all
there is to it -- pain?"
"I observed you in pain, lad. Pain's merely the axis of the test. Your
mother's told you about our ways of observing. I see the signs of her teaching
in you. Our test is crisis and observation."
He heard the confirmation in her voice, said: "It's truth!"
She stared at him. He senses truth! Could he be the one? Could he truly be
the one? She extinguished the excitement, reminding herself: "Hope clouds
observation."
"You know when people believe what they say," she said.
"I know it."
The harmonics of ability confirmed by repeated test were in his voice. She
heard them, said: "Perhaps you are the Kwisatz Haderach. Sit down, little
brother, here at my feet."
"I prefer to stand."
"Your mother sat at my feet once."
"I'm not my mother."
"You hate us a little, eh?" She looked toward the door, called out:
"Jessica!"
The door flew open and Jessica stood there staring hard-eyed into the room.
Hardness melted from her as she saw Paul. She managed a faint smile.
"Jessica, have you ever stopped hating me?" the old woman asked.
"I both love and hate you," Jessica said. "The hate -- that's from pains I
must never forget. The love -- that's . . . "
"Just the basic fact," the old woman said, but her voice was gentle. "You
may come in now, but remain silent. Close that door and mind it that no one
interrupts us."
Jessica stepped into the room, closed the door and stood with her back to
it. My son lives, she thought. My son lives and is . . . human. I knew he was .
. . but . . . he lives. Now, I can go on living. The door felt hard and real
against her back. Everything in the room was immediate and pressing against her
senses.

My son lives.
Paul looked at his mother. She told the truth. He wanted to get away alone
and think this experience through, but knew he could not leave until he was
dismissed. The old woman had gained a power over him. They spoke truth. His
mother had undergone this test. There must be terrible purpose in it . . . the
pain and fear had been terrible. He understood terrible purposes. They drove
against all odds. They were their own necessity. Paul felt that he had been
infected with terrible purpose. He did not know yet what the terrible purpose
was.
"Some day, lad," the old woman said, "you, too, may have to stand outside a
door like that. It takes a measure of doing."
Paul looked down at the hand that had known pain, then up to the Reverend
Mother. The sound of her voice had contained a difference then from any other
voice in his experience. The words were outlined in brilliance. There was an
edge to them. He felt that any question he might ask her would bring an answer
that could lift him out of his flesh-world into something greater.
"Why do you test for humans?" he asked.
"To set you free."
"Free?"
"Once men turned their thinking over to machines in the hope that this would
set them free. But that only permitted other men with machines to enslave them."
" 'Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a man's mind,' " Paul
quoted.
"Right out of the Butlerian Jihad and the Orange Catholic Bible," she said.
"But what the O.C. Bible should've said is: 'Thou shalt not make a machine to
counterfeit a human mind.' Have you studied the Mentat in your service?"
"I've studied with Thufir Hawat."
"The Great Revolt took away a crutch," she said. "It forced human minds to
develop. Schools were started to train human talents. "
"Bene Gesserit schools?"
She nodded. "We have two chief survivors of those ancient schools: the Bene
Gesserit and the Spacing Guild. The Guild, so we think, emphasizes almost pure
mathematics. Bene Gesserit performs another function."
"Politics," he said.
"Kull wahad!" the old woman said. She sent a hard glance at Jessica.
"I've not told him. Your Reverence," Jessica said.
The Reverend Mother returned her attention to Paul. "You did that on
remarkably few clues," she said. "Politics indeed. The original Bene Gesserit
school was directed by those who saw the need of a thread of continuity in human
affairs. They saw there could be no such continuity without separating human
stock from animal stock -- for breeding purposes."
The old woman's words abruptly lost their special sharpness for Paul. He
felt an offense against what his mother called his instinct for rightness. It
wasn't that Reverend Mother lied to him. She obviously believed what she said.
It was something deeper, something tied to his terrible purpose.
He said: "But my mother tells me many Bene Gesserit of the schools don't
know their ancestry."
"The genetic lines are always in our records," she said. "Your mother knows
that either she's of Bene Gesserit descent or her stock was acceptable in
itself."
"Then why couldn't she know who her parents are?"
"Some do . . . Many don't. We might, for example, have wanted to breed her
to a close relative to set up a dominant in some genetic trait. We have many
reasons."
Again, Paul felt the offense against rightness. He said: "You take a lot on
yourselves."
The Reverend Mother stared at him, wondering: Did I hear criticism in his
voice? "We carry a heavy burden," she said.
Paul felt himself coming more and more out of the shock of the test. He
leveled a measuring stare at her, said: "You say maybe I'm the . . . Kwisatz
Haderach. What's that, a human gom jabbar?"
"Paul," Jessica said. "You mustn't take that tone with --"
"I'll handle this, Jessica," the old woman said. "Now, lad, do you know
about the Truthsayer drug?"
"You take it to improve your ability to detect falsehood," he said. "My
mother's told me."
"Have you ever seen truthtrance?"
He shook his head. "No."
"The drug's dangerous," she said, "but it gives insight. When a Truthsayer's
gifted by the drug, she can look many places in her memory -- in her body's
memory. We look down so many avenues of the past . . . but only feminine
avenues." Her voice took on a note of sadness. "Yet, there's a place where no
Truthsayer can see. We are repelled by it, terrorized. It is said a man will
come one day and find in the gift of the drug his inward eye. He will look where
we cannot -- into both feminine and masculine pasts."
"Your Kwisatz Haderach?"
"Yes, the one who can be many places at once: the Kwisatz Haderach. Many men
have tried the drug . . . so many, but none has succeeded."
"They tried and failed, all of them?"
"Oh, no." She shook her head. "They tried and died."

To attempt an understanding of Muad'Dib without understanding his mortal
enemies, the Harkonnens, is to attempt seeing Truth without knowing Falsehood.
It is the attempt to see the Light without knowing Darkness. It cannot be.
-from "Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
It was a relief globe of a world, partly in shadows, spinning under the
impetus of a fat hand that glittered with rings. The globe sat on a freeform
stand at one wall of a windowless room whose other walls presented a patchwork
of multicolored scrolls, filmbooks, tapes and reels. Light glowed in the room
from golden balls hanging in mobile suspensor fields.
An ellipsoid desk with a top of jade-pink petrified elacca wood stood at the
center of the room. Veriform suspensor chairs ringed it, two of them occupied.
In one sat a dark-haired youth of about sixteen years, round of face and with
sullen eyes. The other held a slender, short man with effeminate face.
Both youth and man stared at the globe and the man half-hidden in shadows
spinning it.
A chuckle sounded beside the globe. A basso voice rumbled out of the
chuckle: "There it is, Piter -- the biggest mantrap in all history. And the
Duke's headed into its jaws. Is it not a magnificent thing that I, the Baron
Vladimir Harkonnen, do?"
"Assuredly, Baron," said the man. His voice came out tenor with a sweet,
musical quality.
The fat hand descended onto the globe, stopped the spinning. Now, all eyes
in the room could focus on the motionless surface and see that it was the kind
of globe made for wealthy collectors or planetary governors of the Empire. It
had the stamp of Imperial handicraft about it. Latitude and longitude lines were
laid in with hair-fine platinum wire. The polar caps were insets of finest
cloud-milk diamonds.
The fat hand moved, tracing details on the surface. "I invite you to
observe," the basso voice rumbled. "Observe closely, Piter, and you, too, Feyd-
Rautha, my darling: from sixty degrees north to seventy degrees south -- these
exquisite ripples. Their coloring: does it not remind you of sweet caramels? And
nowhere do you see blue of lakes or rivers or seas. And these lovely polar caps
-- so small. Could anyone mistake this place? Arrakis! Truly unique. A superb
setting for a unique Victory."
A smile touched Piter's lips. "And to think. Baron: the Padishah Emperor
believes he's given the Duke your spice planet. How poignant."
"That's a nonsensical statement," the Baron rumbled. "You say this to
confuse young Feyd-Rautha, but it is not necessary to confuse my nephew."
The sullen-faced youth stirred in his chair, smoothed a wrinkle in the black
leotards he wore. He sat upright as a discreet tapping sounded at the door in
the wall behind him.
Piter unfolded from his chair, crossed to the door, cracked it wide enough
to accept a message cylinder. He closed the door, unrolled the cylinder and
scanned it. A chuckle sounded from him. Another.
"Well?" the Baron demanded.
"The fool answered us, Baron!"
"Whenever did an Atreides refuse the opportunity for a gesture?" the Baron
asked. "Well, what does he say?"
"He's most uncouth, Baron. Addresses you as 'Harkonnen' -- no 'Sire et Cher
Cousin,' no title, nothing."
"It's a good name," the Baron growled, and his voice betrayed his
impatience. "What does dear Leto say?"
"He says: 'Your offer of a meeting is refused. I have ofttimes met your
treachery and this all men know.' "
"And?" the Baron asked.
"He says: 'The art of kanly still has admirers in the Empire.' He signs it:
'Duke Leto of Arrakis.' " Piter began to laugh. "Of Arrakis! Oh, my! This is
almost too rich!"
"Be silent, Piter," the Baron said, and the laughter stopped as though shut
off with a switch. "Kanly, is it?" the Baron asked. "Vendetta, heh? And he uses
the nice old word so rich in tradition to be sure I know he means it."
"You made the peace gesture," Piter said. "The forms have been obeyed."
"For a Mentat, you talk too much, Piter," the Baron said. And he thought: I
must do away with that one soon. He has almost outlived his usefulness. The
Baron stared across the room at his Mental assassin, seeing the feature about
him that most people noticed first: the eyes, the shaded slits of blue within
blue, the eyes without any white in them at all.
A grin flashed across Piter's face. It was like a mask grimace beneath those
eyes like holes. "But, Baron! Never has revenge been more beautiful. It is to
see a plan of the most exquisite treachery: to make Leto exchange Caladan for
Dune -- and without alternative because the Emperor orders it. How waggish of
you!"
In a cold voice, the Baron said: "You have a flux of the mouth, Piter."
"But I am happy, my Baron. Whereas you . . . you are touched by jealousy."
"Piter!"
"Ah-ah. Baron! Is it not regrettable you were unable to devise this
delicious scheme by yourself?"
"Someday I will have you strangled, Piter."
"Of a certainty, Baron. Enfin! But a kind act is never lost, eh?"
"Have you been chewing verite or semuta, Piter?"
"Truth without fear surprises the Baron," Piter said. His face drew down
into a caricature of a frowning mask. "Ah, hah! But you see, Baron, I know as a
Mentat when you will send the executioner. You will hold back just so long as I
am useful. To move sooner would be wasteful and I'm yet of much use. I know what
it is you learned from that lovely Dune planet -- waste not. True, Baron?"
The Baron continued to stare at Piter.

Feyd-Rautha squirmed in his chair. These wrangling fools! he thought. My
uncle cannot talk to his Mental without arguing. Do they think I've nothing to
do except listen their arguments?
"Feyd," the Baron said. "I told you to listen and learn when I invited you
in here. Are you learning?"
"Yes, Uncle." the voice was carefully subservient.
"Sometimes I wonder about Piter," the Baron said. "I cause pain out of
necessity, but he . . . I swear he takes a positive delight in it. For myself, I
can feel pity toward the poor Duke Leto. Dr. Yueh will move against him soon,
and that'll be the end of all the Atreides. But surely Leto will know whose hand
directed the pliant doctor . . . and knowing that will be a terrible thing."
"Then why haven't you directed the doctor to slip a kindjal between his ribs
quietly and efficiently?" Piter asked. "You talk of pity, but --"
"The Duke must know when I encompass his doom," the Baron said. "And the
other Great Houses must learn of it. The knowledge will give them pause. I'll
gain a bit more room to maneuver. The necessity is obvious, but I don't have to
like it."
"Room to maneuver," Piter sneered. "Already you have the Emperor's eyes on
you, Baron. You move too boldly. One day the Emperor will send a legion or two
of his Sardaukar down here onto Giedi Prime and that'll be an end to the Baron
Vladimir Harkonnen."
"You'd like to see that, wouldn't you, Piter?" the Baron asked. "You'd enjoy
seeing the Corps of Sardaukar pillage through my cities and sack this castle.
You'd truly enjoy that."
"Does the Baron need to ask?" Piter whispered.
"You should've been a Bashar of the Corps," the Baron said. "You're too
interested in blood and pain. Perhaps I was too quick with my promise of the
spoils of Arrakis."
Piter took five curiously mincing steps into the room, stopped directly
behind Feyd-Rautha. There was a tight air of tension in the room, and the youth
looked up at Piter with a worried frown.
"Do not toy with Piter, Baron," Piter said. "You promised me the Lady
Jessica. You promised her to me."
"For what, Piter?" the Baron asked. "For pain?"
Piter stared at him, dragging out the silence.
Feyd-Rautha moved his suspensor chair to one side, said: "Uncle, do I have
to stay? You said you'd --"
"My darling Feyd-Rautha grows impatient," the Baron said. He moved within
the shadows beside the globe. "Patience, Feyd." And he turned his attention back
to the Mentat. "What of the Dukeling, the child Paul, my dear Piter?"
"The trap will bring him to you, Baron," Piter muttered.
"That's not my question," the Baron said. "You'll recall that you predicted
the Bene Gesserit witch would bear a daughter to the Duke. You were wrong, eh,
Mentat?"
"I'm not often wrong, Baron," Piter said, and for the first time there was
fear in his voice. "Give me that: I'm not often wrong. And you know yourself
these Bene Gesserit bear mostly daughters. Even the Emperor's consort had
produced only females."
"Uncle," said Feyd-Rautha, "you said there'd be something important here for
me to --"
"Listen to my nephew," the Baron said. "He aspires to rule my Barony, yet he
cannot rule himself." The Baron stirred beside the globe, a shadow among
shadows. "Well then, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen, I summoned you here hoping to teach
you a bit of wisdom. Have you observed our good Mentat? You should've learned
something from this exchange."
"But, Uncle --"
"A most efficient Mentat, Piter, wouldn't you say, Feyd?"
"Yes, but --"
"Ah! Indeed but! But he consumes too much spice, eats it like candy. Look at
his eyes! He might've come directly from the Arrakeen labor pool. Efficient,
Piter, but he's still emotional and prone to passionate outbursts. Efficient,
Piter, but he still can err."
Piter spoke in a low, sullen tone: "Did you call me in here to impair my
efficiency with criticism, Baron?"
"Impair your efficiency? You know me better, Piter. I wish only for my
nephew to understand the limitations of a Mentat."
"Are you already training my replacement?" Piter demanded.
"Replace you? Why, Piter, where could I find another Mentat with your
cunning and venom?"
"The same place you found me, Baron."
"Perhaps I should at that," the Baron mused. "You do seem a bit unstable
lately. And the spice you eat!"
"Are my pleasures too expensive, Baron? Do you object to them?"
"My dear Piter, your pleasures are what tie you to me. How could I object to
that? I merely wish my nephew to observe this about you."
"Then I'm on display," Piter said. "Shall I dance? Shall I perform my
various functions for the eminent Feyd-Rau-"
"Precisely," the Baron said. "You are on display. Now, be silent." He
glanced at Feyd-Rautha, noting his nephew's lips, the full and pouting look of
them, the Harkonnen genetic marker, now twisted slightly in amusement. "This is
a Mentat, Feyd. It has been trained and conditioned to perform certain duties.
The fact that it's encased in a human body, however, must not be overlooked. A
serious drawback, that. I sometimes think the ancients with their thinking
machines had the right idea."
"They were toys compared to me," Piter snarled. "You yourself, Baron, could
outperform those machines."
"Perhaps," the Baron said. "Ah, well . . . " He took a deep breath, belched.
"Now, Piter, outline for my nephew the salient features of our campaign against
the House of Atreides. Function as a Mentat for us, if you please."
"Baron, I've warned you not to trust one so young with this information. My
observations of --"
"I'll be the judge of this," the Baron said. "I give you an order, Mentat.
Perform one of your various functions."
"So be it," Piter said. He straightened, assuming an odd attitude of dignity
-- as though it were another mask, but this time clothing his entire body. "In a
few days Standard, the entire household of the Duke Leto will embark on a
Spacing Guild liner for Arrakis. The Guild will deposit them at the city of
Arrakeen rather than at our city of Carthag. The Duke's Mentat, Thufir Hawat,
will have concluded rightly that Arrakeen is easier to defend."
"Listen carefully, Feyd," the Baron said. "Observe the plans within plans
within plans."
Feyd-Rautha nodded, thinking: This is more like it. The old monster is
letting me in on secret things at last. He must really mean for me to be his
heir.
"There are several tangential possibilities," Piter said. "I indicate that
House Atreides will go to Arrakis. We must not, however, ignore the possibility
the Duke has contracted with the Guild to remove him to a place of safety
outside the System. Others in like circumstances have become renegade Houses,
taking family atomics and shields and fleeing beyond the Imperium."
"The Duke's too proud a man for that," the Baron said.
"It is a possibility," Piter said. "The ultimate effect for us would be the
same, however."
"No, it would not!" the Baron growled. "I must have him dead and his line
ended."
"That's the high probability," Piter said. "There are certain preparations
that indicate when a House is going renegade. The Duke appears to be doing none
of these things."
"So," the Baron sighed. "Get on with it, Piter."
"At Arrakeen," Piter said, "the Duke and his family will occupy the
Residency, lately the home of Count and Lady Fenring."
"The Ambassador to the Smugglers," the Baron chuckled.
"Ambassador to what?" Feyd-Rautha asked.
"Your uncle makes a joke," Piter said. "He calls Count Fenring Ambassador to
the Smugglers, indicating the Emperor's interest in smuggling operations on
Arrakis."
Feyd-Rautha turned a puzzled stare on his uncle. "Why?"
"Don't be dense, Feyd," the Baron snapped. "As long as the Guild remains
effectively outside Imperial control, how could it be otherwise? How else could
spies and assassins move about?"
Feyd-Rautha's mouth made a soundless "Oh-h-h-h."
"We've arranged diversions at the Residency," Piter said. "There'll be an
attempt on the life of the Atreides heir -- an attempt which could succeed."
"Piter," the Baron rumbled, "you indicated --"
"I indicated accidents can happen," Piter said. "And the attempt must appear
valid."
"Ah, but the lad has such a sweet young body," the Baron said. "Of course,
he's potentially more dangerous than the father . . . with that witch mother
training him. Accursed woman! Ah, well, please continue, Piter."
"Hawat will have divined that we have an agent planted on him," Piter said.
"The obvious suspect is Dr. Yueh, who is indeed our agent. But Hawat has
investigated and found that our doctor is a Suk School graduate with Imperial
Conditioning -- supposedly safe enough to minister even to the Emperor. Great
store is set on Imperial Conditioning. It's assumed that ultimate conditioning
cannot be removed without killing the subject. However, as someone once
observed, given the right lever you can move a planet. We found the lever that
moved the doctor."
"How?" Feyd-Rautha asked. He found this a fascinating subject. Everyone knew
you couldn't subvert Imperial Conditioning!
"Another time," the Baron said. "Continue, Piter."
"In place of Yueh," Piter said, "we'll drag a most interesting suspect
across Hawat's path. The very audacity of this suspect will recommend her to
Hawat's attention."
"Her?" Feyd-Rautha asked.
"The Lady Jessica herself," the Baron said.
"Is it not sublime?" Piter asked. "Hawat's mind will be so filled with this
prospect it'll impair his function as a Mentat. He may even try to kill her."
Piter frowned, then: "But I don't think he'll be able to carry it off."
"You don't want him to, eh?" the Baron asked.
"Don't distract me," Piter said. "While Hawat's occupied with the Lady
Jessica, we'll divert him further with uprisings in a few garrison towns and the
like. These will be put down. The Duke must believe he's gaining a measure of
security. Then, when the moment is ripe, we'll signal Yueh and move in with our
major force . . . ah . . . "
"Go ahead, tell him all of it," the Baron said.
"We'll move in strengthened by two legions of Sardaukar disguised in
Harkonnen livery."
"Sardaukar!" Feyd-Rautha breathed. His mind focused on the dread Imperial
troops, the killers without mercy, the soldier fanatics of the Padishah Emperor.
"You see how I trust you, Feyd," the Baron said. "No hint of this must ever
reach another Great House, else the Landsraad might unite against the Imperial
House and there'd be chaos."
"The main point," Piter said, "is this: since House Harkonnen is being used
to do the Imperial dirty work, we've gained a true advantage. It's a dangerous
advantage, to be sure, but if used cautiously, will bring House Harkonnen
greater wealth than that of any other House in the Imperium."
"You have no idea how much wealth is involved, Feyd," the Baron said. "Not
in your wildest imaginings. To begin, we'll have an irrevocable directorship in
the CHOAM Company."
Feyd-Rautha nodded. Wealth was the thing. CHOAM was the key to wealth, each
noble House dipping from the company's coffers whatever it could under the power
of the directorships. Those CHOAM directorships -- they were the real evidence
of political power in the Imperium, passing with the shifts of voting strength
within the Landsraad as it balanced itself against the Emperor and his
supporters.
"The Duke Leto," Piter said, "may attempt to flee to the new Fremen scum
along the desert's edge. Or he may try to send his family into that imagined
security. But that path is blocked by one of His Majesty's agents -- the
planetary ecologist. You may remember him -- Kynes."
"Feyd remembers him," the Baron said. "Get on with it."
"You do not drool very prettily, Baron," Piter said.
"Get on with it, I command you!" the Baron roared.
Piter shrugged. "If matters go as planned," he said, "House Harkonnen will
have a subfief on Arrakis within a Standard year. Your uncle will have
dispensation of that fief. His own personal agent will rule on Arrakis."
"More profits," Feyd-Rautha said.
"Indeed," the Baron said. And he thought: It's only just. We're the ones who
tamed Arrakis . . .except for the few mongrel Fremen hiding in the skirts of the
desert . . . and some tame smugglers bound to the planet almost as tightly as
the native labor pool.
"And the Great Houses will know that the Baron has destroyed the Atreides,"
Piter said. "They will know."
"They will know," the Baron breathed.
"Loveliest of all," Piter said, "is that the Duke will know, too. He knows
now. He can already feel the trap."
"It's true the Duke knows," the Baron said, and his voice held a note of
sadness. "He could not help but know . . . more's the pity."
The Baron moved out and away from the globe of Arrakis. As he emerged from
the shadows, his figure took on dimension -- grossly and immensely fat. And with
subtle bulges beneath folds of his dark robes to reveal that all this fat was
sustained partly by portable suspensors harnessed to his flesh. He might weigh
two hundred Standard kilos in actuality, but his feet would carry no more than
fifty of them.
"I am hungry," the Baron rumbled, and he rubbed his protruding lips with a
beringed hand, stared down at Feyd-Rautha through fat-enfolded eyes. "Send for
food, my darling. We will eat before we retire."

Thus spoke St. Alia-of-the-Knife: "The Reverend Mother must combine the
seductive wiles of a courtesan with the untouchable majesty of a virgin goddess,
holding these attributes in tension so long as the powers of her youth endure.
For when youth and beauty have gone, she will find that the place-between, once
occupied by tension, has become a wellspring of cunning and resourcefulness."
-from "Muad'Dib, Family Commentaries" by the Princess Irulan
"Well, Jessica, what have you to say for yourself?" asked the Reverend
Mother.

It was near sunset at Castle Caladan on the day of Paul's ordeal. The two
women were alone in Jessica's morning room while Paul waited in the adjoining
soundproofed Meditation Chamber.
Jessica stood facing the south windows. She saw and yet did not see the
evening's banked colors across meadow and river. She heard and yet did not hear
the Reverend Mother's question.
There had been another ordeal once -- so many years ago. A skinny girl with
hair the color of bronze, her body tortured by the winds of puberty, had entered
the study of the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, Proctor Superior of the
Bene Gesserit school on Wallach IX. Jessica looked down at her right hand,
flexed the fingers, remembering the pain, the terror, the anger.
"Poor Paul," she whispered.
"I asked you a question, Jessica!" The old woman's voice was snappish,
demanding.
"What? Oh . . . " Jessica tore her attention away from the past, faced the
Reverend Mother, who sat with back to the stone wall between the two west
windows. "What do you want me to say?"
"What do I want you to say? What do I want you to say?" The old voice
carried a tone of cruel mimicry.
"So I had a son!" Jessica flared. And she knew she was being goaded into
this anger deliberately.
"You were told to bear only daughters to the Atreides."
"It meant so much to him," Jessica pleaded.
"And you in your pride thought you could produce the Kwisatz Haderach!"
Jessica lifted her chin. "I sensed the possibility."
"You thought only of your Duke's desire for a son," the old woman snapped.
"And his desires don't figure in this. An Atreides daughter could've been wed to
a Harkonnen heir and sealed the breach. You've hopelessly complicated matters.
We may lose both bloodlines now."
"You're not infallible," Jessica said. She braved the steady stare from the
old eyes.
Presently, the old woman muttered: "What's done is done."
"I vowed never to regret my decision," Jessica said.
"How noble," the Reverend Mother sneered. "No regrets. We shall see when
you're a fugitive with a price on your head and every man's hand turned against
you to seek your life and the life of your son."
Jessica paled. "Is there no alternative?"
"Alternative? A Bene Gesserit should ask that?"
"I ask only what you see in the future with your superior abilities."
"I see in the future what I've seen in the past. You well know the pattern
of our affairs, Jessica. The race knows its own mortality and fears stagnation
of its heredity. It's in the bloodstream -- the urge to mingle genetic strains
without plan. The Imperium, the CHOAM Company, all the Great Houses, they are
but bits of flotsam in the path of the flood."
"CHOAM," Jessica muttered. "I suppose it's already decided how they'll
redivide the spoils of Arrakis."
"What is CHOAM but the weather vane of our times," the old woman said. "The
Emperor and his friends now command fifty-nine point six-five per cent of the
CHOAM directorship's votes. Certainly they smell profits, and likely as others
smell those same profits his voting strength will increase. This is the pattern
of history, girl."
"That's certainly what I need right now," Jessica said. "A review of
history."
"Don't be facetious, girl! You know as well as I do what forces surround us.
We've a three-point civilization: the Imperial Household balanced against the
Federated Great Houses of the Landsraad, and between them, the Guild with its
damnable monopoly on interstellar transport. In politics, the tripod is the most
unstable of all structures. It'd be bad enough without the complication of a
feudal trade culture which turns its back on most science."
Jessica spoke bitterly: "Chips in the path of the flood -- and this chip
here, this is the Duke Leto, and this one's his son, and this one's --"
"Oh, shut up, girl. You entered this with full knowledge of the delicate
edge you walked."
" 'I am Bene Gesserit: I exist only to serve,' " Jessica quoted.
"Truth." the old woman said. "And all we can hope for now is to prevent this
from erupting into general conflagration, to salvage what we can of the key
bloodlines."
Jessica closed her eyes, feeling tears press out beneath the lids. She
fought down the inner trembling, the outer trembling, the uneven breathing, the
ragged pulse, the sweating of the palms. Presently, she said, "I'll pay for my
own mistake."
"And your son will pay with you."
"I'll shield him as well as I'm able."
"Shield!" the old woman snapped. "You well know the weakness there! Shield
your son too much, Jessica, and he'll not grow strong enough to fulfill any
destiny."
Jessica turned away, looked out the window at the gathering darkness. "Is it
really that terrible, this planet of Arrakis?"
"Bad enough, but not all bad. The Missionaria Protectiva has been in there
and softened it up somewhat." The Reverend Mother heaved herself to her feet,
straightened a fold in her gown. "Call the boy in here. I must be leaving soon."
"Must you?"
The old woman's voice softened. "Jessica, girl, I wish I could stand in your
place and take your sufferings. But each of us must make her own path."
"I know."
"You're as dear to me as any of my own daughters, but I cannot let that
interfere with duty."
"I understand . . . the necessity."
"What you did, Jessica, and why you did it -- we both know. But kindness
forces me to tell you there's little chance your lad will be the Bene Gesserit
Totality. You mustn't let yourself hope too much."
Jessica shook tears from the corners of her eyes. It was an angry gesture.
"You make me feel like a little girl again -- reciting my first lesson." She
forced the words out: " 'Humans must never submit to animals.' " A dry sob shook
her. In a low voice, she said: "I've been so lonely."
"It should be one of the tests," the old woman said. "Humans are almost
always lonely. Now summon the boy. He's had a long, frightening day. But he's
had time to think and remember, and I must ask the other questions about these
dreams of his."
Jessica nodded, went to the door of the Meditation Chamber, opened it.
"Paul, come in now, please."
Paul emerged with a stubborn slowness. He stared at his mother as though she
were a stranger. Wariness veiled his eyes when he glanced at the Reverend
Mother, but this time he nodded to her, the nod one gives an equal. He heard his
mother close the door behind him.
"Young man," the old woman said, "let's return to this dream business."
"What do you want?"
"Do you dream every night?"
"Not dreams worth remembering. I can remember every dream, but some are
worth remembering and some aren't."
"How do you know the difference?"
"I just know it."
The old woman glanced at Jessica, back to Paul. "What did you dream last
night? Was it worth remembering?"
"Yes." Paul closed his eyes. "I dreamed a cavern . . . and water . . . and a
girl there -- very skinny with big eyes. Her eyes are all blue, no whites in
them. I talk to her and tell her about you, about seeing the Reverend Mother on
Caladan." Paul opened his eyes.
"And the thing you tell this strange girl about seeing me, did it happen
today?"
Paul thought about this, then: "Yes. I tell the girl you came and put a
stamp of strangeness on me."
"Stamp of strangeness," the old woman breathed, and again she shot a glance
at Jessica, returned her attention to Paul. "Tell me truly now, Paul, do you
often have dreams of things that happen afterward exactly as you dreamed them?"
"Yes. And I've dreamed about that girl before."
"Oh? You know her?"
"I will know her."
"Tell me about her."
Again, Paul closed his eyes. "We're in a little place in some rocks where
it's sheltered. It's almost night, but it's hot and I can see patches of sand
out of an opening in the rocks. We're . . . waiting for something . . . for me
to go meet some people. And she's frightened but trying to hide it from me, and
I'm excited. And she says: 'Tell me about the waters of your homeworld, Usul.' "
Paul opened his eyes. "Isn't that strange? My homeworld's Caladan. I've never
even heard of a planet called Usul."
"Is there more to this dream?" Jessica prompted.
"Yes. But maybe she was calling me Usul," Paul said. "I just thought of
that." Again, he closed his eyes. "She asks me to tell her about the waters. And
I take her hand. And I say I'll tell her a poem. And I tell her the poem, but I
have to explain some of the words -- like beach and surf and seaweed and
seagulls."
"What poem?" the Reverend Mother asked.
Paul opened his eyes. "It's just one of Gurney Halleck's tone poems for sad
times."
Behind Paul Jessica began to recite:
"I remember salt smoke from a beach fire
And shadows under the pines -Solid, clean . . . fixed -Seagulls perched at the tip of land,
White upon green . . .
And a wind comes through the pines
To sway the shadows;
The seagulls spread their wings,
Lift
And fill the sky with screeches.
And I hear the wind
Blowing across our beach,
And the surf,
And I see that our fire
Has scorched the seaweed."
"That's the one," Paul said.
The old woman stared at Paul, then: "Young man, as a Proctor of the Bene
Gesserit, I seek the Kwisatz Haderach, the male who truly can become one of us.
Your mother sees this possibility in you, but she sees with the eyes of a
mother. Possibility I see, too, but no more."
She fell silent and Paul saw that she wanted him to speak. He waited her
out.

Presently, she said: "As you will, then. You've depths in you; that I'll
grant."
"May I go now?" he asked.
"Don't you want to hear what the Reverend Mother can tell you about the
Kwisatz Haderach?" Jessica asked.
"She said those who tried for it died."
"But I can help you with a few hints at why they failed," the Reverend
Mother said.
She talks of hints, Paul thought. She doesn't really know anything. And he
said: "Hint then."
"And be damned to me?" She smiled wryly, a crisscross of wrinkles in the old
face. "Very well: 'That which submits rules.' "
He felt astonishment: she was talking about such elementary things as
tension within meaning. Did she think his mother had taught him nothing at all?
"That's a hint?" he asked.
"We're not here to bandy words or quibble over their meaning," the old woman
said. "The willow submits to the wind and prospers until one day it is many
willows -- a wall against the wind. This is the willow's purpose."
Paul stared at her. She said purpose and he felt the word buffet him,
reinfecting him with terrible purpose. He experienced a sudden anger at her:
fatuous old witch with her mouth full of platitudes.
"You think I could be this Kwisatz Haderach," he said. "You talk about me,
but you haven't said one thing about what we can do to help my father. I've
heard you talking to my mother. You talk as though my father were dead. Well, he
isn't!"
"If there were a thing to be done for him, we'd have done it," the old woman
growled. "We may be able to salvage you. Doubtful, but possible. But for your
father, nothing. When you've learned to accept that as a fact, you've learned a
real Bene Gesserit lesson."
Paul saw how the words shook his mother. He glared at the old woman. How
could she say such a thing about his father? What made her so sure? His mind
seethed with resentment.
The Reverend Mother looked at Jessica. "You've been training him in the Way
-- I've seen the signs of it. I'd have done the same in your shoes and devil
take the Rules."
Jessica nodded.
"Now, I caution you," said the old woman, "to ignore the regular order of
training. His own safety requires the Voice. He already has a good start in it,
but we both know how much more he needs . . . and that desperately." She stepped
close to Paul, stared down at him. "Goodbye, young human. I hope you make it.
But if you don't -- well, we shall yet succeed."
Once more she looked at Jessica. A flicker sign of understanding passed
between them. Then the old woman swept from the room, her robes hissing, with
not another backward glance. The room and its occupants already were shut from
her thoughts.
But Jessica had caught one glimpse of the Reverend Mother's face as she
turned away. There had been tears on the seamed cheeks. The tears were more
unnerving than any other word or sign that had passed between them this day.

You have read that Muad'Dib had no playmates his own age on Caladan. The dangers
were too great. But Muad'Dib did have wonderful companion-teachers. There was
Gurney Halleck, the troubadour-warrior. You will sing some of Gurney's songs, as
you read along in this book. There was Thufir Hawat, the old Mentat Master of
Assassins, who struck fear even into the heart of the Padishah Emperor. There
were Duncan Idaho, the Swordmaster of the Ginaz; Dr. Wellington Yueh, a name
black in treachery but bright in knowledge; the Lady Jessica, who guided her son
in the Bene Gesserit Way, and -- of course -- the Duke Leto, whose qualities as
a father have long been overlooked.
-from "A Child's History of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
Thufir Hawat slipped into the training room of Castle Caladan, closed the
door softly. He stood there a moment, feeling old and tired and storm-leathered.
His left leg ached where it had been slashed once in the service of the Old
Duke.
Three generations of them now, he thought.
He stared across the big room bright with the light of noon pouring through
the skylights, saw the boy seated with back to the door, intent on papers and
charts spread across an ell table.
How many times must I tell that lad never to settle himself with his back to
a door? Hawat cleared his throat.
Paul remained bent over his studies.
A cloud shadow passed over the skylights. Again, Hawat cleared his throat.
Paul straightened, spoke without turning: "I know. I'm sitting with my back
to a door."
Hawat suppressed a smile, strode across the room.
Paul looked up at the grizzled old man who stopped at a corner of the table.
Hawat's eyes were two pools of alertness in a dark and deeply seamed face.
"I heard you coming down the hall," Paul said. "And I heard you open the
door."
"The sounds I make could be imitated."
"I'd know the difference."
He might at that, Hawat thought. That witch-mother of his is giving him the
deep training, certainly. I wonder what her precious school thinks of that?
Maybe that's why they sent the old Proctor here -- to whip our dear Lady Jessica
into line.
Hawat pulled up a chair across from Paul, sat down facing the door. He did
it pointedly, leaned back and studied the room. It struck him as an odd place
suddenly, a stranger-place with most of its hardware already gone off to
Arrakis. A training table remained, and a fencing mirror with its crystal prisms
quiescent, the target dummy beside it patched and padded, looking like an
ancient foot soldier maimed and battered in the wars.
There stand I, Hawat thought.
"Thufir, what're you thinking?" Paul asked.
Hawat looked at the boy. "I was thinking we'll all be out of here soon and
likely never see the place again."
"Does that make you sad?"
"Sad? Nonsense! Parting with friends is a sadness. A place is only a place."
He glanced at the charts on the table. "And Arrakis is just another place."
"Did my father send you up to test me?"
Hawat scowled -- the boy had such observing ways about him. He nodded.
"You're thinking it'd have been nicer if he'd come up himself, but you must know
how busy he is. He'll be along later."
"I've been studying about the storms on Arrakis."
"The storms. I see."
"They sound pretty bad."
"That's too cautious a word: bad. Those storms build up across six or seven
thousand kilometers of flatlands, feed on anything that can give them a push -coriolis force, other storms, anything that has an ounce of energy in it. They
can blow up to seven hundred kilometers an hour, loaded with everything loose
that's in their way -- sand, dust, everything. They can eat flesh off bones and
etch the bones to slivers."
"Why don't they have weather control?"
"Arrakis has special problems, costs are higher, and there'd be maintenance
and the like. The Guild wants a dreadful high price for satellite control and
your father's House isn't one of the big rich ones, lad. You know that."
"Have you ever seen the Fremen?"
The lad's mind is darting all over today, Hawat thought.
"Like as not I have seen them," he said. "There's little to tell them from
the folk of the graben and sink. They all wear those great flowing robes. And
they stink to heaven in any closed space. It's from those suits they wear -call them 'stillsuits' -- that reclaim the body's own water."
Paul swallowed, suddenly aware of the moisture in his mouth, remembering a
dream of thirst. That people could want so for water they had to recycle their
body moisture struck him with a feeling of desolation. "Water's precious there,"
he said.
Hawat nodded, thinking: Perhaps I'm doing it, getting across to him the
importance of this planet as an enemy. It's madness to go in there without that
caution in our minds.
Paul looked up at the skylight, aware that it had begun to rain. He saw the
spreading wetness on the gray meta-glass. "Water," he said.
"You'll learn a great concern for water," Hawat said. "As the Duke's son
you'll never want for it, but you'll see the pressures of thirst all around
you."
Paul wet his lips with his tongue, thinking back to the day a week ago and
the ordeal with the Reverend Mother. She, too, had said something about water
starvation.
"You'll learn about the funeral plains," she'd said, "about the wilderness
that is empty, the wasteland where nothing lives except the spice and the
sandworms. You'll stain your eyepits to reduce the sun glare. Shelter will mean
a hollow out of the wind and hidden from view. You'll ride upon your own two
feet without 'thopter or groundcar or mount."
And Paul had been caught more by her tone -- singsong and wavering -- than
by her words.
"When you live upon Arrakis," she had said, "khala, the land is empty. The
moons will be your friends, the sun your enemy."
Paul had sensed his mother come up beside him away from her post guarding
the door. She had looked at the Reverend Mother and asked: "Do you see no hope.
Your Reverence?"
"Not for the father." And the old woman had waved Jessica to silence, looked
down at Paul. "Grave this on your memory, lad: A world is supported by four
things . . . " She held up four big-knuckled fingers. ". . . the learning of the
wise, the justice of the great, the prayers of the righteous and the valor of
the brave. But all of these are as nothing . . . " She closed her fingers into a
fist. ". . . without a ruler who knows the art of ruling. Make that the science
of your tradition!"
A week had passed since that day with the Reverend Mother. Her words were
only now beginning to come into full register. Now, sitting in the training room
with Thufir Hawat, Paul felt a sharp pang of fear. He looked across at the
Mentat's puzzled frown.
"Where were you woolgathering that time?" Hawat asked.
"Did you meet the Reverend Mother?"
"That Truthsayer witch from the Imperium?" Hawat's eyes quickened with
interest. "I met her."
"She . . . " Paul hesitated, found that he couldn't tell Hawat about the
ordeal. The inhibitions went deep.
"Yes? What did she?"
Paul took two deep breaths. "She said a thing." He closed his eyes, calling
up the words, and when he spoke his voice unconsciously took on some of the old
woman's tone: " 'You, Paul Atreides, descendant of kings, son of a Duke, you
must learn to rule. It's something none of your ancestors learned.' " Paul
opened his eyes, said: "That made me angry and I said my father rules an entire
planet. And she said, 'He's losing it.' And I said my father was getting a
richer planet. And she said. 'He'll lose that one, too.' And I wanted to run and
warn my father, but she said he'd already been warned -- by you, by Mother, by
many people."
"True enough," Hawat muttered.
"Then why're we going?" Paul demanded.
"Because the Emperor ordered it. And because there's hope in spite of what
that witch-spy said. What else spouted from this ancient fountain of wisdom?"
Paul looked down at his right hand clenched into a fist beneath the table.
Slowly, he willed the muscles to relax. She put some kind of hold on me, he
thought. How?
"She asked me to tell her what it is to rule," Paul said. "And I said that
one commands. And she said I had some unlearning to do."
She hit a mark there right enough, Hawat thought. He nodded for Paul to
continue.
"She said a ruler must learn to persuade and not to compel. She said he must
lay the best coffee hearth to attract the finest men."
"How'd she figure your father attracted men like Duncan and Gurney?" Hawat
asked.
Paul shrugged. "Then she said a good ruler has to learn his world's
language, that it's different for every world. And I thought she meant they
didn't speak Galach on Arrakis, but she said that wasn't it at all. She said she
meant the language of the rocks and growing things, the language you don't hear
just with your ears. And I said that's what Dr. Yueh calls the Mystery of Life."
Hawat chuckled. "How'd that sit with her?"
"I think she got mad. She said the mystery of life isn't a problem to solve,
but a reality to experience. So I quoted the First Law of Mentat at her: 'A
process cannot be understood by stopping it. Understanding must move with the
flow of the process, must join it and flow with it.' That seemed to satisfy
her."
He seems to be getting over it, Hawat thought, but that old witch frightened
him. Why did she do it?
"Thufir," Paul said, "will Arrakis be as bad as she said?"
"Nothing could be that bad," Hawat said and forced a smile. "Take those
Fremen, for example, the renegade people of the desert. By first-approximation
analysis, I can tell you there're many, many more of them than the Imperium
suspects. People live there, lad: a great many people, and . . ." Hawat put a
sinewy finger beside his eye. ". . . they hate Harkonnens with a bloody passion.
You must not breathe a word of this, lad. I tell you only as your father's
helper."
"My father has told me of Salusa Secundus," Paul said. "Do you know, Thufir,
it sounds much like Arrakis . . . perhaps not quite as bad, but much like it."
"We do not really know of Salusa Secundus today," Hawat said. "Only what it
was like long ago . . . mostly. But what is known -- you're right on that
score."
"Will the Fremen help us?"
"It's a possibility." Hawat stood up. "I leave today for Arrakis. Meanwhile,
you take care of yourself for an old man who's fond of you, heh? Come around
here like the good lad and sit facing the door. It's not that I think there's
any danger in the castle; it's just a habit I want you to form."
Paul got to his feet, moved around the table. "You're going today?"
"Today it is, and you'll be following tomorrow. Next time we meet it'll be
on the soil of your new world." He gripped Paul's right arm at the bicep. "Keep
your knife arm free, heh? And your shield at full charge." He released the arm,
patted Paul's shoulder, whirled and strode quickly to the door.

"Thufir! "Paul called.
Hawat turned, standing in the open doorway.
"Don't sit with your back to any doors," Paul said.
A grin spread across the seamed old face. "That I won't, lad. Depend on it."
And he was gone, shutting the door softly behind.
Paul sat down where Hawat had been, straightened the papers. One more day
here, he thought. He looked around the room. We 're leaving. The idea of
departure was suddenly more real to him than it had ever been before. He
recalled another thing the old woman had said about a world being the sum of
many things -- the people, the dirt, the growing things, the moons, the tides,
the suns -- the unknown sum called nature, a vague summation without any sense
of the now. And he wondered: What is the now?
The door across from Paul banged open and an ugly lump of a man lurched
through it preceded by a handful of weapons.
"Well, Gurney Halleck," Paul called, "are you the new weapons master?"
Halleck kicked the door shut with one heel. "You'd rather I came to play
games, I know," he said. He glanced abound the room, noting that Hawat's men
already had been over it, checking, making it safe for a duke's heir. The subtle
code signs were all around.
Paul watched the rolling, ugly man set himself back in motion, veer toward
the training table with the load of weapons, saw the nine-string baliset slung
over Gurney's shoulder with the multipick woven through the strings near the
head of the fingerboard.
Halleck dropped the weapons on the exercise table, lined them up -- the
rapiers, the bodkins, the kindjals, the slow-pellet stunners, the shield belts.
The inkvine scar along his jawline writhed as he turned, casting a smile across
the room.
"So you don't even have a good morning for me, you young imp," Halleck said.
"And what barb did you sink in old Hawat? He passed me in the hall like a man
running to his enemy's funeral."
Paul grinned. Of all his father's men, he liked Gurney Halleck best, knew
the man's moods and deviltry, his humors, and thought of him more as a friend
than as a hired sword.
Halleck swung the baliset off his shoulder, began tuning it. "If y' won't
talk, y' won't," he said.
Paul stood, advanced across the room, calling out: "Well, Gurney, do we come
prepared for music when it's fighting time?"
"So it's sass for our elders today," Halleck said. He tried a chord on the
instrument, nodded.
"Where's Duncan Idaho?" Paul asked. "Isn't he supposed to be teaching me
weaponry?"
"Duncan's gone to lead the second wave onto Arrakis," Halleck said. "All you
have left is poor Gurney who's fresh out of fight and spoiling for music." He
struck another chord, listened to it, smiled. "And it was decided in council
that you being such a poor fighter we'd best teach you the music trade so's you
won't waste your life entire."
"Maybe you'd better sing me a lay then," Paul said. "I want to be sure how
not to do it."
"Ah-h-h, hah!" Gurney laughed, and he swung into "Galacian Girls." his
multipick a blur over the strings as he sang:
"Oh-h-h, the Galacian girls
Will do it for pearls,
And the Arrakeen for water!
But if you desire dames
Like consuming flames,
Try a Caladanin daughter!"
"Not bad for such a poor hand with the pick," Paul said, "but if my mother
heard you singing a bawdy like that in the castle, she'd have your ears on the
outer wall for decoration."
Gurney pulled at his left ear. "Poor decoration, too, they having been
bruised so much listening at keyholes while a young lad I know practiced some
strange ditties on his baliset."
"So you've forgotten what it's like to find sand in your bed," Paul said. He
pulled a shield belt from the table, buckled it fast around his waist. "Then,
let's fight!"
Halleck's eyes went wide in mock surprise. "So! It was your wicked hand did
that deed! Guard yourself today, young master -- guard yourself." He grabbed up
a rapier, laced the air with it. "I'm a hellfiend out for revenge!"
Paul lifted the companion rapier, bent it in his hands, stood in the aguile,
one foot forward. He let his manner go solemn in a comic imitation of Dr. Yueh.
"What a dolt my father sends me for weaponry," Paul intoned. "This doltish
Gurney Halleck has forgotten the first lesson for a fighting man armed and
shielded." Paul snapped the force button at his waist, felt the crinkled-skin
tingling of the defensive field at his forehead and down his back, heard
external sounds take on characteristic shield-filtered flatness. "In shield
fighting, one moves fast on defense, slow on attack," Paul said. "Attack has the
sole purpose of tricking the opponent into a misstep, setting him up for the
attack sinister. The shield turns the fast blow, admits the slow kindjal!" Paul
snapped up the rapier, feinted fast and whipped it back for a slow thrust timed
to enter a shield's mindless defenses.
Halleck watched the action, turned at the last minute to let the blunted
blade pass his chest. "Speed, excellent," he said. "But you were wide open for
an underhanded counter with a slip-tip."
Paul stepped back, chagrined.
"I should whap your backside for such carelessness," Halleck said. He lifted
a naked kindjal from the table and held it up. "This in the hand of an enemy can
let out your life's blood! You're an apt pupil, none better, but I've warned you
that not even in play do you let a man inside your guard with death in his
hand."
"I guess I'm not in the mood for it today," Paul said.
"Mood?" Halleck's voice betrayed his outrage even through the shield's
filtering. "What has mood to do with it? You fight when the necessity arises -no matter the mood! Mood's a thing for cattle or making love or playing the
baliset. It's not for fighting."
"I'm sorry, Gurney."
"You're not sorry enough!"
Halleck activated his own shield, crouched with kindjal outthrust in left
hand, the rapier poised high in his right. "Now I say guard yourself for true!"
He leaped high to one side, then forward, pressing a furious attack.
Paul fell back, parrying. He felt the field crackling as shield edges
touched and repelled each other, sensed the electric tingling of the contact
along his skin. What's gotten into Gurney? he asked himself. He's not faking
this! Paul moved his left hand, dropped his bodkin into his palm from its wrist
sheath.
"You see a need for an extra blade, eh?" Halleck grunted.
Is this betrayal? Paul wondered. Surely not Gurney!
Around the room they fought -- thrust and parry, feint and counterfeint. The
air within their shield bubbles grew stale from the demands on it that the slow
interchange along barrier edges could not replenish. With each new shield
contact, the smell of ozone grew stronger.

Paul continued to back, but now he directed his retreat toward the exercise
table. If I can turn him beside the table, I'll show him a trick, Paul thought.
One more step, Gurney.
Halleck took the step.
Paul directed a parry downward, turned, saw Halleck's rapier catch against
the table's edge. Paul flung himself aside, thrust high with rapier and came in
across Halleck's neckline with the bodkin. He stopped the blade an inch from the
jugular.
"Is this what you seek?" Paul whispered.
"Look down, lad," Gurney panted.
Paul obeyed, saw Halleck's kindjal thrust under the table's edge, the tip
almost touching Paul's groin.
"We'd have joined each other in death," Halleck said. "But I'll admit you
fought some better when pressed to it. You seemed to get the mood." And he
grinned wolfishly, the inkvine scar rippling along his jaw.
"The way you came at me," Paul said. "Would you really have drawn my blood?"
Halleck withdrew the kindjal, straightened. "If you'd fought one whit
beneath your abilities. I'd have scratched you a good one, a scar you'd
remember. I'll not have my favorite pupil fall to the first Harkonnen tramp who
happens along."
Paul deactivated his shield, leaned on the table to catch his breath. "I
deserved that, Gurney. But it would've angered my father if you'd hurt me. I'll
not have you punished for my failing."
"As to that," Halleck said, "it was my failing, too. And you needn't worry
about a training scar or two. You're lucky you have so few. As to your father -the Duke'd punish me only if I failed to make a first-class fighting man out of
you. And I'd have been failing there if I hadn't explained the fallacy in this
mood thing you've suddenly developed."
Paul straightened, slipped his bodkin back into its wrist sheath.
"It's not exactly play we do here," Halleck said.
Paul nodded. He felt a sense of wonder at the uncharacteristic seriousness
in Halleck's manner, the sobering intensity. He looked at the beet-colored
inkvine scar on the man's jaw, remembering the story of how it had been put
there by Beast Rabban in a Harkonnen slave pit on Giedi Prime. And Paul felt a
sudden shame that he had doubted Halleck even for an instant. It occurred to
Paul, then, that the making of Halleck's scar had been accompanied by pain -- a
pain as intense, perhaps, as that inflicted by a Reverend Mother. He thrust this
thought aside; it chilled their world.
"I guess I did hope for some play today," Paul said. "Things are so serious
around here lately."
Halleck turned away to hide his emotions. Something burned in his eyes.
There was pain in him -- like a blister, all that was left of some lost
yesterday that Time had pruned off him.
How soon this child must assume his manhood, Halleck thought. How soon he
must read that form within his mind, that contract of brutal caution, to enter
the necessary fact on the necessary line: "Please list your next of kin."
Halleck spoke without turning: "I sensed the play in you, lad, and I'd like
nothing better than to join in it. But this no longer can be play. Tomorrow we
go to Arrakis. Arrakis is real. The Harkonnens are real."
Paul touched his forehead with his rapier blade held vertical.
Halleck turned, saw the salute and acknowledged it with a nod. He gestured
to the practice dummy. "Now, we'll work on your timing. Let me see you catch
that thing sinister. I'll control it from over here where I can have a full view
of the action. And I warn you I'll be trying new counters today. There's a
warning you'd not get from a real enemy."
Paul stretched up on his toes to relieve his muscles. He felt solemn with
the sudden realization that his life had become filled with swift changes. He
crossed to the dummy, slapped the switch on its chest with his rapier tip and
felt the defensive field forcing his blade away.
"En garde!" Halleck called, and the dummy pressed the attack.
Paul activated his shield, parried and countered.
Halleck watched as he manipulated the controls. His mind seemed to be in two
parts: one alert to the needs of the training fight, and the other wandering in
fly-buzz.
I'm the well-trained fruit tree, he thought. Full of well-trained feelings
and abilities and all of them grafted onto me -- all bearing for someone else to
pick.
For some reason, he recalled his younger sister, her elfin face so clear in
his mind. But she was dead now -- in a pleasure house for Harkonnen troops. She
had loved pansies . . . or was it daisies? He couldn't remember. It bothered him
that he couldn't remember.
Paul countered a slow swing of the dummy, brought up his left hand
entretisser.
That clever little devil! Halleck thought, intent now on Paul's interweaving
hand motions. He's been practicing and studying on his own. That's not Duncan's
style, and it's certainly nothing I've taught him.
This thought only added to Halleck's sadness. I'm infected by mood, he
thought. And he began to wonder about Paul, if the boy ever listened fearfully
to his pillow throbbing in the night.
"If wishes were fishes we'd all cast nets," he murmured.
It was his mother's expression and he always used it when he felt the
blackness of tomorrow on him. Then he thought what an odd expression that was to
be taking to a planet that had never known seas or fishes.

YUEH (yu'e), Wellington (weling-tun), Stdrd 10,082-10,191; medical doctor of the
Suk School (grd Stdrd 10,112); md: Wanna Marcus, B.G. (Stdrd 10,092-10,186?);
chiefly noted as betrayer of Duke Leto Atreides. (Cf: Bibliography, Appendix VII
[Imperial Conditioning] and Betrayal, The.)
-from "Dictionary of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
Although he heard Dr. Yueh enter the training room, noting the stiff
deliberation of the man's pace, Paul remained stretched out face down on the
exercise table where the masseuse had left him. He felt deliciously relaxed
after the workout with Gurney Halleck.
"You do look comfortable," said Yueh in his calm, high-pitched voice.
Paul raised his head, saw the man's stick figure standing several paces
away, took in at a glance the wrinkled black clothing, the square block of a
head with purple lips and drooping mustache, the diamond tattoo of Imperial
Conditioning on his forehead, the long black hair caught in the Suk School's
silver ring at the left shoulder.
"You'll be happy to hear we haven't time for regular lessons today," Yueh
said. "Your father will be along presently."
Paul sat up.
"However, I've arranged for you to have a filmbook viewer and several
lessons during the crossing to Arrakis."
"Oh."
Paul began pulling on his clothes. He felt excitement that his father would
be coming. They had spent so little time together since the Emperor's command to
take over the fief of Arrakis.
Yueh crossed to the ell table, thinking: How the boy has filled out these
past few months. Such a waste! Oh, such a sad waste. And he reminded himself: I
must not falter. What I do is done to be certain my Wanna no longer can be hurt
by the Harkonnen beasts.
Paul joined him at the table, buttoning his jacket. "What'll I be studying
on the way across?"
"Ah-h-h-h, the terranic life forms of Arrakis. The planet seems to have
opened its arms to certain terranic life forms. It's not clear how. I must seek
out the planetary ecologist when we arrive -- a Dr. Kynes -- and offer my help
in the investigation."
And Yueh thought: What am I saying? I play the hypocrite even with myself.
"Will there be something on the Fremen?" Paul asked.
"The Fremen?" Yueh drummed his fingers on the table, caught Paul staring at
the nervous motion, withdrew his hand.
"Maybe you have something on the whole Arrakeen population," Paul said.
"Yes, to be sure," Yueh said. "There are two general separations of the
people -- Fremen, they are one group, and the others are the people of the
graben, the sink, and the pan. There's some intermarriage, I'm told. The women
of pan and sink villages prefer Fremen husbands; their men prefer Fremen wives.
They have a saying: 'Polish comes from the cities; wisdom from the desert.' "
"Do you have pictures of them?"
"I'll see what I can get you. The most interesting feature, of course, is
their eyes -- totally blue, no whites in them."
"Mutation?"
"No; it's linked to saturation of the blood with melange."
"The Fremen must be brave to live at the edge of that desert."
"By all accounts," Yueh said. "They compose poems to their knives. Their
women are as fierce as the men. Even Fremen children are violent and dangerous.
You'll not be permitted to mingle with them, I daresay."
Paul stared at Yueh, finding in these few glimpses of the Fremen a power of
words that caught his entire attention. What a people to win as allies!
"And the worms?" Paul asked.
"What?"
"I'd like to study more about the sandworms."
"Ah-h-h-h, to be sure. I've a filmbook on a small specimen, only one hundred
and ten meters long and twenty-two meters in diameter. It was taken in the
northern latitudes. Worms of more than four hundred meters in length have been
recorded by reliable witnesses, and there's reason to believe even larger ones
exist."
Paul glanced down at a conical projection chart of the northern Arrakeen
latitudes spread on the table. "The desert belt and south polar regions are
marked uninhabitable. Is it the worms?"
"And the storms."
"But any place can be made habitable."
"If it's economically feasible," Yueh said. "Arrakis has many costly
perils." He smoothed his drooping mustache. "Your father will be here soon.
Before I go, I've a gift for you, something I came across in packing." He put an
object on the table between them -- black, oblong, no larger than the end of
Paul's thumb.
Paul looked at it. Yueh noted how the boy did not reach for it, and thought:
How cautious he is.
"It's a very old Orange Catholic Bible made for space travelers. Not a
filmbook, but actually printed on filament paper. It has its own magnifier and
electrostatic charge system." He picked it up, demonstrated. "The book is held
closed by the charge, which forces against spring-locked covers. You press the
edge -- thus, and the pages you've selected repel each other and the book
opens."
"It's so small."
"But it has eighteen hundred pages. You press the edge -- thus, and so . . .
and the charge moves ahead one page at a time as you read. Never touch the
actual pages with your fingers. The filament tissue is too delicate." He closed
the book, handed it to Paul. "Try it."
Yueh watched Paul work the page adjustment, thought: I salve my own
conscience. I give him the surcease of religion before betraying him. Thus may I
say to myself that he has gone where I cannot go.
"This must've been made before filmbooks," Paul said.
"It's quite old. Let it be our secret, eh? Your parents might think it too
valuable for one so young."
And Yueh thought: His mother would surely wonder at my motives.
"Well . . . " Paul closed the book, held it in his hand. "If it's so
valuable . . . "
"Indulge an old man's whim," Yueh said. "It was given to me when I was very
young." And he thought: I must catch his mind as well as his cupidity. "Open it
to four-sixty-seven Kalima -- where it says: 'From water does all life begin.'
There's a slight notch on the edge of the cover to mark the place."
Paul felt the cover, detected two notches, one shallower than the other. He
pressed the shallower one and the book spread open on his palm, its magnifier
sliding into place.
"Read it aloud," Yueh said.
Paul wet his lips with his tongue, read: "Think you of the fact that a deaf
person cannot hear. Then, what deafness may we not all possess? What senses do
we lack that we cannot see and cannot hear another world all around us? What is
there around us that we cannot --"
"Stop it!" Yueh barked.
Paul broke off, stared at him.
Yueh closed his eyes, fought to regain composure. What perversity caused the
book to open at my Wanna's favorite passage? He opened his eyes, saw Paul
staring at him.
"Is something wrong?" Paul asked.
"I'm sorry," Yueh said. "That was . . . my . . . dead wife's favorite
passage. It's not the one I intended you to read. It brings up memories that are
. . . painful."
"There are two notches," Paul said.
Of course, Yueh thought. Wanna marked her passage. His fingers are more
sensitive than mine and found her mark. It was an accident, no more.
"You may find the book interesting," Yueh said. "It has much historical
truth in it as well as good ethical philosophy."
Paul looked down at the tiny book in his palm -- such a small thing. Yet, it
contained a mystery . . . something had happened while he read from it. He had
felt something stir his terrible purpose.
"Your father will be here any minute," Yueh said. "Put the book away and
read it at your leisure."
Paul touched the edge of it as Yueh had shown him. The book sealed itself.
He slipped it into his tunic. For a moment there when Yueh had barked at him,
Paul had feared the man would demand the book's return.
"I thank you for the gift. Dr. Yueh," Paul said, speaking formally. "It will
be our secret. If there is a gift of favor you wish from me, please do not
hesitate to ask."
"I . . . need for nothing," Yueh said.
And he thought: Why do I stand here torturing myself? And torturing this
poor lad . . . though he does not know it. Oeyh! Damn those Harkonnen beasts!
Why did they choose me for their abomination?

How do we approach the study of Muad'Dib's father? A man of surpassing warmth
and surprising coldness was the Duke Leto Atreides. Yet, many facts open the way
to this Duke: his abiding love for his Bene Gesserit lady; the dreams he held
for his son; the devotion with which men served him. You see him there -- a man
snared by Destiny, a lonely figure with his light dimmed behind the glory of his
son. Still, one must ask: What is the son but an extension of the father?
-from "Muad'Dib, Family Commentaries" by the Princess Irulan
Paul watched his father enter the training room, saw the guards take up
stations outside. One of them closed the door. As always, Paul experienced a
sense of presence in his father, someone totally here.
The Duke was tall, olive-skinned. His thin face held harsh angles warmed
only by deep gray eyes. He wore a black working uniform with red armorial hawk
crest at the breast. A silvered shield belt with the patina of much use girded
his narrow waist.
The Duke said: "Hard at work, Son?"
He crossed to the ell table, glanced at the papers on it, swept his gaze
around the room and back to Paul. He felt tired, filled with the ache of not
showing his fatigue. I must use every opportunity to rest during the crossing to
Arrakis, he thought. There'll be no rest on Arrakis.
"Not very hard," Paul said. "Everything's so . . . " He shrugged.
"Yes. Well, tomorrow we leave. It'll be good to get settled in our new home,
put all this upset behind."
Paul nodded, suddenly overcome by memory of the Reverend Mother's words: " .
. . for the father, nothing."
"Father," Paul said, "will Arrakis be as dangerous as everyone says?"
The Duke forced himself to the casual gesture, sat down on a corner of the
table, smiled. A whole pattern of conversation welled up in his mind -- the kind
of thing he might use to dispel the vapors in his men before a battle. The
pattern froze before it could be vocalized, confronted by the single thought:
This is my son.
"It'll be dangerous," he admitted.
"Hawat tells me we have a plan for the Fremen," Paul said. And he wondered:
Why don't I tell him what that old woman said? How did she seal my tongue?
The Duke noted his son's distress, said: "As always, Hawat sees the main
chance. But there's much more. I see also the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer
Mercantiles -- the CHOAM Company. By giving me Arrakis, His Majesty is forced to
give us a CHOAM directorship . . . a subtle gain."
"CHOAM controls the spice," Paul said.
"And Arrakis with its spice is our avenue into CHOAM," the Duke said.
"There's more to CHOAM than melange."
"Did the Reverend Mother warn you?" Paul blurted. He clenched his fists,
feeling his palms slippery with perspiration. The effort it had taken to ask
that question.
"Hawat tells me she frightened you with warnings about Arrakis," the Duke
said. "Don't let a woman's fears cloud your mind. No woman wants her loved ones
endangered. The hand behind those warnings was your mother's. Take this as a
sign of her love for us."
"Does she know about the Fremen?"
"Yes, and about much more."
"What?"
And the Duke thought: The truth could be worse than he imagines, but even
dangerous facts are valuable if you've been trained to deal with them. And
there's one place where nothing has been spared for my son -- dealing with
dangerous facts. This must be leavened, though; he is young.
"Few products escape the CHOAM touch," the Duke said. "Logs, donkeys,
horses, cows, lumber, dung, sharks, whale fur -- the most prosaic and the most
exotic . . . even our poor pundi rice from Caladan. Anything the Guild will
transport, the art forms of Ecaz, the machines of Richesse and Ix. But all fades
before melange. A handful of spice will buy a home on Tupile. It cannot be
manufactured, it must be mined on Arrakis. It is unique and it has true
geriatric properties."
"And now we control it?"
"To a certain degree. But the important thing is to consider all the Houses
that depend on CHOAM profits. And think of the enormous proportion of those
profits dependent upon a single product -- the spice. Imagine what would happen
if something should reduce spice production."
"Whoever had stockpiled melange could make a killing," Paul said. "Others
would be out in the cold."
The Duke permitted himself a moment of grim satisfaction, looking at his son
and thinking how penetrating, how truly educated that observation had been. He
nodded. "The Harkonnens have been stockpiling for more than twenty years."
"They mean spice production to fail and you to be blamed."
"They wish the Atreides name to become unpopular," the Duke said. "Think of
the Landsraad Houses that look to me for a certain amount of leadership -- their
unofficial spokesman. Think how they'd react if I were responsible for a serious
reduction in their income. After all, one's own profits come first. The Great
Convention be damned! You can't let someone pauperize you!" A harsh smile
twisted the Duke's mouth. "They'd look the other way no matter what was done to
me."
"Even if we were attacked with atomics?"
"Nothing that flagrant. No open defiance of the Convention. But almost
anything else short of that . . . perhaps even dusting and a bit of soil
poisoning."
"Then why are we walking into this?"
"Paul!" The Duke frowned at his son. "Knowing where the trap is -- that's
the first step in evading it. This is like single combat, Son, only on a larger
scale -- a feint within a feint within a feint . . . seemingly without end. The
task is to unravel it. Knowing that the Harkonnens stockpile melange, we ask
another question: Who else is stockpiling? That's the list of our enemies."
"Who?"
"Certain Houses we knew were unfriendly and some we'd thought friendly. We
need not consider them for the moment because there is one other much more
important: our beloved Padishah Emperor."
Paul tried to swallow in a throat suddenly dry. "Couldn't you convene the
Landsraad, expose --"
"Make our enemy aware we know which hand holds the knife? Ah, now, Paul -we see the knife, now. Who knows where it might be shifted next? If we put this
before the Landsraad it'd only create a great cloud of confusion. The Emperor
would deny it. Who could gainsay him? All we'd gain is a little time while
risking chaos. And where would the next attack come from?"
"All the Houses might start stockpiling spice."
"Our enemies have a head start -- too much of a lead to overcome."
"The Emperor," Paul said. "That means the Sardaukar."
"Disguised in Harkonnen livery, no doubt," the Duke said. "But the soldier
fanatics nonetheless."
"How can Fremen help us against Sardaukar?"
"Did Hawat talk to you about Salusa Secundus?"
"The Emperor's prison planet? No."
"What if it were more than a prison planet, Paul? There's a question you
never hear asked about the Imperial Corps of Sardaukar: Where do they come
from?"
"From the prison planet?"
"They come from somewhere."
"But the supporting levies the Emperor demands from --"
"That's what we're led to believe: they're just the Emperor's levies trained
young and superbly. You hear an occasional muttering about the Emperor's
training cadres, but the balance of our civilization remains the same: the
military forces of the Landsraad Great Houses on one side, the Sardaukar and
their supporting levies on the other. And their supporting levies, Paul. The
Sardaukar remain the Sardaukar."
"But every report on Salusa Secundus says S.S. is a hell world!"
"Undoubtedly. But if you were going to raise tough, strong, ferocious men,
what environmental conditions would you impose on them?"
"How could you win the loyalty of such men?"
"There are proven ways: play on the certain knowledge of their superiority,
the mystique of secret covenant, the esprit of shared suffering. It can be done.
It has been done on many worlds in many times."
Paul nodded, holding his attention on his father's face. He felt some
revelation impending.
"Consider Arrakis," the Duke said. "When you get outside the towns and
garrison villages, it's every bit as terrible a place as Salusa Secundus."
Paul's eyes went wide. "The Fremen!"
"We have there the potential of a corps as strong and deadly as the
Sardaukar. It'll require patience to exploit them secretly and wealth to equip
them properly. But the Fremen are there . . . and the spice wealth is there. You
see now why we walk into Arrakis, knowing the trap is there."
"Don't the Harkonnens know about the Fremen?"
"The Harkonnens sneered at the Fremen, hunted them for sport, never even
bothered trying to count them. We know the Harkonnen policy with planetary
populations -- spend as little as possible to maintain them."
The metallic threads in the hawk symbol above his father's breast glistened
as the Duke shifted his position. "You see?"
"We're negotiating with the Fremen right now," Paul said.
"I sent a mission headed by Duncan Idaho," the Duke said. "A proud and
ruthless man, Duncan, but fond of the truth. I think the Fremen will admire him.
If we're lucky, they may judge us by him: Duncan, the moral."
"Duncan, the moral," Paul said, "and Gurney the valorous."
"You name them well," the Duke said.
And Paul thought: Gurney's one of those the Reverend Mother meant, a
supporter of worlds -- " . . . the valor of the brave."
"Gurney tells me you did well in weapons today," the Duke said.
"That isn't what he told me."
The Duke laughed aloud. "I figured Gurney to be sparse with his praise. He
says you have a nicety of awareness -- in his own words -- of the difference
between a blade's edge and its tip."
"Gurney says there's no artistry in killing with the tip, that it should be
done with the edge."
"Gurney's a romantic," the Duke growled. This talk of killing suddenly
disturbed him, coming from his son. "I'd sooner you never had to kill . . . but
if the need arises, you do it however you can -- tip or edge." He looked up at
the skylight, on which the rain was drumming.
Seeing the direction of his father's stare, Paul thought of the wet skies
out there -- a thing never to be seen on Arrakis from all accounts -- and this
thought of skies put him in mind of the space beyond. "Are the Guild ships
really big?" he asked.
The Duke looked at him. "This will be your first time off planet," he said.
"Yes, they're big. We'll be riding a Heighliner because it's a long trip. A
Heighliner is truly big. Its hold will tuck all our frigates and transports into
a little corner -- we'll be just a small part of the ship's manifest."
"And we won't be able to leave our frigates?"
"That's part of the price you pay for Guild Security. There could be
Harkonnen ships right alongside us and we'd have nothing to fear from them. The
Harkonnens know better than to endanger their shipping privileges."
"I'm going to watch our screens and try to see a Guildsman."
"You won't. Not even their agents ever see a Guildsman. The Guild's as
jealous of its privacy as it is of its monopoly. Don't do anything to endanger
our shipping privileges, Paul."
"Do you think they hide because they've mutated and don't look . . . human
anymore?"
"Who knows?" The Duke shrugged. "It's a mystery we're not likely to solve.
We've more immediate problems -- among them: you."
"Me?"
"Your mother wanted me to be the one to tell you, Son. You see, you may have
Mentat capabilities."
Paul stared at his father, unable to speak for a moment, then: "A Mentat?
Me? But I . . . "
"Hawat agrees, Son. It's true."
"But I thought Mentat training had to start during infancy and the subject
couldn't be told because it might inhibit the early . . . " He broke off, all
his past circumstances coming to focus in one flashing computation. "I see," he
said.
"A day comes," the Duke said, "when the potential Mentat must learn what's
being done. It may no longer be done to him. The Mentat has to share in the
choice of whether to continue or abandon the training. Some can continue; some
are incapable of it. Only the potential Mentat can tell this for sure about
himself."
Paul rubbed his chin. All the special training from Hawat and his mother -the mnemonics, the focusing of awareness, the muscle control and sharpening of
sensitivities, the study of languages and nuances of voices -- all of it clicked
into a new kind of understanding in his mind.
"You'll be the Duke someday, Son," his father said. "A Mentat Duke would be
formidable indeed. Can you decide now . . . or do you need more time?"
There was no hesitation in his answer. "I'll go on with the training."
"Formidable indeed," the Duke murmured, and Paul saw the proud smile on his
father's face. The smile shocked Paul: it had a skull look on the Duke's narrow
features. Paul closed his eyes, feeling the terrible purpose reawaken within
him. Perhaps being a Mentat is terrible purpose, he thought.
But even as he focused on this thought, his new awareness denied it.

With the Lady Jessica and Arrakis, the Bene Gesserit system of sowing implantlegends through the Missionaria Protectiva came to its full fruition. The wisdom
of seeding the known universe with a prophecy pattern for the protection of B.G.
personnel has long been appreciated, but never have we seen a condition-utextremis with more ideal mating of person and preparation. The prophetic legends
had taken on Arrakis even to the extent of adopted labels (including Reverend
Mother, canto and respondu, and most of the Shari-a panoplia propheticus). And
it is generally accepted now that the Lady Jessica's latent abilities were
grossly underestimated.
-from "Analysis: The Arrakeen Crisis" by the Princess Irulan [Private
circulation: B.G. file number AR-81088587]
All around the Lady Jessica -- piled in corners of the Arrakeen great hall,
mounded in the open spaces -- stood the packaged freight of their lives: boxes,
trunks, cartons, cases -- some partly unpacked. She could hear the cargo
handlers from the Guild shuttle depositing another load in the entry.

Jessica stood in the center of the hall. She moved in a slow turn, looking
up and around at shadowed carvings, crannies and deeply recessed windows. This
giant anachronism of a room reminded her of the Sisters' Hall at her Bene
Gesserit school. But at the school the effect had been of warmth. Here, all was
bleak stone.
Some architect had reached far back into history for these buttressed walls
and dark hangings, she thought. The arched ceiling stood two stories above her
with great crossbeams she felt sure had been shipped here to Arrakis across
space at monstrous cost. No planet of this system grew trees to make such beams
-- unless the beams were imitation wood.
She thought not.
This had been the government mansion in the days of the Old Empire. Costs
had been of less importance then. It had been before the Harkonnens and their
new megalopolis of Carthag -- a cheap and brassy place some two hundred
kilometers northeast across the Broken Land. Leto had been wise to choose this
place for his seat of government. The name, Arrakeen, had a good sound, filled
with tradition. And this was a smaller city, easier to sterilize and defend.
Again there came the clatter of boxes being unloaded in the entry. Jessica
sighed.
Against a carton to her right stood the painting of the Duke's father.
Wrapping twine hung from it like a frayed decoration. A piece of the twine was
still clutched in Jessica's left hand. Beside the painting lay a black bull's
head mounted on a polished board. The head was a dark island in a sea of wadded
paper. Its plaque lay flat on the floor, and the bull's shiny muzzle pointed at
the ceiling as though the beast were ready to bellow a challenge into this
echoing room.
Jessica wondered what compulsion had brought her to uncover those two things
first -- the head and the painting. She knew there was something symbolic in the
action. Not since the day when the Duke's buyers had taken her from the school
had she felt this frightened and unsure of herself.
The head and the picture.
They heightened her feelings of confusion. She shuddered, glanced at the
slit windows high overhead. It was still early afternoon here, and in these
latitudes the sky looked black and cold -- so much darker than the warm blue of
Caladan. A pang of homesickness throbbed through her.
So far away, Caladan.
"Here we are!"
The voice was Duke Leto's.
She whirled, saw him striding from the arched passage to the dining hall.
His black working uniform with red armorial hawk crest at the breast looked
dusty and rumpled.
"I thought you might have lost yourself in this hideous place," he said.
"It is a cold house," she said. She looked at his tallness, at the dark skin
that made her think of olive groves and golden sun on blue waters. There was
woodsmoke in the gray of his eyes, but the face was predatory: thin, full of
sharp angles and planes.
A sudden fear of him tightened her breast. He had become such a savage,
driving person since the decision to bow to the Emperor's command.
"The whole city feels cold," she said.
"It's a dirty, dusty little garrison town," he agreed. "But we'll change
that." He looked around the hall. "These are public rooms for state occasions.
I've just glanced at some of the family apartments in the south wing. They're
much nicer." He stepped closer, touched her arm, admiring her stateliness.
And again, he wondered at her unknown ancestry -- a renegade House, perhaps?
Some black-barred royalty? She looked more regal than the Emperor's own blood.
Under the pressure of his stare, she turned half away, exposing her profile.
And he realized there was no single and precise thing that brought her beauty to
focus. The face was oval under a cap of hair the color of polished bronze. Her
eyes were set wide, as green and clear as the morning skies of Caladan. The nose
was small, the mouth wide and generous. Her figure was good but scant: tall and
with its curves gone to slimness.
He remembered that the lay sisters at the school had called her skinny, so
his buyers had told him. But that description oversimplified. She had brought a
regal beauty back into the Atreides line. He was glad that Paul favored her.
"Where's Paul?" he asked.
"Someplace around the house taking his lessons with Yueh."
"Probably in the south wing," he said. "I thought I heard Yueh's voice, but
I couldn't take time to look." He glanced down at her, hesitating. "I came here
only to hang the key of Caladan Castle in the dining hall."
She caught her breath, stopped the impulse to reach out to him. Hanging the
key -- there was finality in that action. But this was not the time or place for
comforting. "I saw our banner over the house as we came in," she said.
He glanced at the painting of his father. "Where were you going to hang
that?"
"Somewhere in here."
"No." The word rang flat and final, telling her she could use trickery to
persuade, but open argument was useless. Still, she had to try, even if the
gesture served only to remind herself that she would not trick him.
"My Lord," she said, "if you'd only . . . "
"The answer remains no. I indulge you shamefully in most things, not in
this. I've just come from the dining hall where there are --"
"My Lord! Please."
"The choice is between your digestion and my ancestral dignity, my dear," he
said. "They will hang in the dining hall."
She sighed. "Yes, my Lord."
"You may resume your custom of dining in your rooms whenever possible. I
shall expect you at your proper position only on formal occasions."
"Thank you, my Lord."
"And don't go all cold and formal on me! Be thankful that I never married
you, my dear. Then it'd be your duty to join me at table for every meal."
She held her face immobile, nodded.
"Hawat already has our own poison snooper over the dining table," he said.
"There's a portable in your room."
"You anticipated this . . . disagreement," she said.
"My dear, I think also of your comfort. I've engaged servants. They're
locals, but Hawat has cleared them -- they're Fremen all. They'll do until our
own people can be released from their other duties."
"Can anyone from this place be truly safe?"
"Anyone who hates Harkonnens. You may even want to keep the head
housekeeper: the Shadout Mapes."
"Shadout," Jessica said. "A Fremen title?"
"I'm told it means 'well-dipper,' a meaning with rather important overtones
here. She may not strike you as a servant type, although Hawat speaks highly of
her on the basis of Duncan's report. They're convinced she wants to serve -specifically that she wants to serve you."
"Me?"
"The Fremen have learned that you're Bene Gesserit," he said. "There are
legends here about the Bene Gesserit."
The Missionaria Protectiva, Jessica thought. No place escapes them.
"Does this mean Duncan was successful?" she asked. "Will the Fremen be our
allies?"
"There's nothing definite," he said. "They wish to observe us for a while,
Duncan believes. They did, however, promise to stop raiding our outlying
villages during a truce period. That's a more important gain than it might seem.

Hawat tells me the Fremen were a deep thorn in the Harkonnen side, that the
extent of their ravages was a carefully guarded secret. It wouldn't have helped
for the Emperor to learn the ineffectiveness of the Harkonnen military."
"A Fremen housekeeper," Jessica mused, returning to the subject of the
Shadout Mapes. "She'll have the all-blue eyes."
"Don't let the appearance of these people deceive you," he said. "There's a
deep strength and healthy vitality in them. I think they'll be everything we
need."
"It's a dangerous gamble," she said.
"Let's not go into that again," he said.
She forced a smile. "We are committed, no doubt of that." She went through
the quick regimen of calmness -- the two deep breaths, the ritual thought, then:
"When I assign rooms, is there anything special I should reserve for you?"
"You must teach me someday how you do that," he said, "the way you thrust
your worries aside and turn to practical matters. It must be a Bene Gesserit
thing."
"It's a female thing," she said.
He smiled. "Well, assignment of rooms: make certain, I have large office
space next my sleeping quarters. There'll be more paper work here than on
Caladan. A guard room, of course. That should cover it. Don't worry about
security of the house. Hawat's men have been over it in depth."
"I'm sure they have."
He glanced at his wristwatch. "And you might see that all our timepieces are
adjusted for Arrakeen local. I've assigned a tech to take care of it. He'll be
along presently." He brushed a strand of her hair back from her forehead. "I
must return to the landing field now. The second shuttle's due any minute with
my staff reserves."
"Couldn't Hawat meet them, my Lord? You look so tired."
"The good Thufir is even busier than I am. You know this planet's infested
with Harkonnen intrigues. Besides, I must try persuading some of the trained
spice hunters against leaving. They have the option, you know, with the change
of fief -- and this planetologist the Emperor and the Landsraad installed as
Judge of the Change cannot be bought. He's allowing the opt. About eight hundred
trained hands expect to go out on the spice shuttle and there's a Guild cargo
ship standing by."
"My Lord . . . " She broke off, hesitating.
"Yes?"
He will not be persuaded against trying to make this planet secure for us,
she thought. And I cannot use my tricks on him.
"At what time will you be expecting dinner?" she asked.
That's not what she was going to say, he thought. Ah-h-h-h, my Jessica,
would that we were somewhere else, anywhere away from this terrible place -alone, the two of us, without a care.
"I'll eat in the officers' mess at the field," he said. "Don't expect me
until very late. And . . .ah, I'll be sending a guardcar for Paul. I want him to
attend our strategy conference."
He cleared his throat as though to say something else, then, without
warning, turned and strode out, headed for the entry where she could hear more
boxes being deposited. His voice sounded once from there, commanding and
disdainful, the way he always spoke to servants when he was in a hurry: "The
Lady Jessica's in the Great Hall. Join her there immediately."
The outer door slammed.
Jessica turned away, faced the painting of Leto's father. It had been done
by the famed artist, Albe, during the Old Duke's middle years. He was portrayed
in matador costume with a magenta cape flung over his left arm. The face looked
young, hardly older than Leto's now, and with the same hawk features, the same
gray stare. She clenched her fists at her sides, glared at the painting.

"Damn you! Damn you! Damn you!" she whispered.
"What are your orders, Noble Born?"
It was a woman's voice, thin and stringy.
Jessica whirled, stared down at a knobby, gray-haired woman in a shapeless
sack dress of bondsman brown. The woman looked as wrinkled and desiccated as any
member of the mob that had greeted them along the way from the landing field
that morning. Every native she had seen on this planet, Jessica thought, looked
prune dry and undernourished. Yet, Leto had said they were strong and vital. And
there were the eyes, of course -- that wash of deepest, darkest blue without any
white -- secretive, mysterious. Jessica forced herself not to stare.
The woman gave a stiff-necked nod, said: "I am called the Shadout Mapes,
Noble Born. What are your orders?"
"You may refer to me as 'my Lady,' " Jessica said. "I'm not noble born. I'm
the bound concubine of the Duke Leto."
Again that strange nod, and the woman peered upward at Jessica with a sly
questioning, "There's a wife, then?"
"There is not, nor has there ever been. I am the Duke's only . . .
companion, the mother of his heir-designate."
Even as she spoke, Jessica laughed inwardly at the pride behind her words.
What was it St. Augustine said? she asked herself. "The mind commands the body
and it obeys. The mind orders itself and meets resistance." Yes -- I am meeting
more resistance lately. I could use a quiet retreat by myself.
A weird cry sounded from the road outside the house. It was repeated: "Soosoo-Sook! Soo-soo-Sook!" Then: "Ikhut-eigh! Ikhut-eigh!" And again: "Soo-sooSook!"
"What is that?" Jessica asked. "I heard it several times as we drove through
the streets this morning."
"Only a water-seller, my Lady. But you've no need to interest yourself in
such as they. The cistern here holds fifty thousand liters and it's always kept
full." She glanced down at her dress. "Why, you know, my Lady, I don't even have
to wear my stillsuit here?" She cackled. "And me not even dead!"
Jessica hesitated, wanting to question this Fremen woman, needing data to
guide her. But bringing order of the confusion in the castle was more
imperative. Still, she found the thought unsettling that water was a major mark
of wealth here.
"My husband told me of your title, Shadout," Jessica said. "I recognized the
word. It's a very ancient word."
"You know the ancient tongues then?" Mapes asked, and she waited with an odd
intensity.
"Tongues are the Bene Gesserit's first learning," Jessica said. "I know the
Bhotani Jib and the Chakobsa, all the hunting languages."
Mapes nodded. "Just as the legend says."
And Jessica wondered: Why do I play out this sham? But the Bene Gesserit
ways were devious and compelling.
"I know the Dark Things and the ways of the Great Mother," Jessica said. She
read the more obvious signs in Mapes' actions and appearance, the petit
betrayals. "Miseces prejia," she said in the Chakobsa tongue. "Andral t're pera!
Trada cik buscakri miseces perakri --"
Mapes took a backward step, appeared poised to flee.
"I know many things." Jessica said. "I know that you have borne children,
that you have lost loved ones, that you have hidden in fear and that you have
done violence and will yet do more violence. I know many things."
In a low voice, Mapes said: "I meant no offense, my Lady."
"You speak of the legend and seek answers," Jessica said. "Beware the
answers you may find. I know you came prepared for violence with a weapon in
your bodice."
"My Lady, I . . . "
"There's a remote possibility you could draw my life's blood," Jessica said,
"but in so doing you'd bring down more ruin than your wildest fears could
imagine. There are worse things than dying, you know -- even for an entire
people."
"My Lady!" Mapes pleaded. She appeared about to fall to her knees. "The
weapon was sent as a gift to you should you prove to be the One."
"And as the means of my death should I prove otherwise," Jessica said. She
waited in the seeming relaxation that made the Bene Gesserit-trained so
terrifying in combat.
Now we see which way the decision tips, she thought.
Slowly, Mapes reached into the neck of her dress, brought out a dark sheath.
A black handle with deep finger ridges protruded from it. She took sheath in one
hand and handle in the other, withdrew a milk-white blade, held it up. The blade
seemed to shine and glitter with a light of its own. It was double-edged like a
kindjal and the blade was perhaps twenty centimeters long.
"Do you know this, my Lady?" Mapes asked.
It could only be one thing, Jessica knew, the fabled crysknife of Arrakis,
the blade that had never been taken off the planet, and was known only by rumor
and wild gossip.
"It's a crysknife," she said.
"Say it not lightly," Mapes said. "Do you know its meaning?"
And Jessica thought: There was an edge to that question. Here's the reason
this Fremen has taken service with me, to ask that one question. My answer could
precipitate violence or . . . what? She seeks an answer from me: the meaning of
a knife. She's called the Shadow in the Chakobsa tongue. Knife, that's "Death
Maker" in Chakobsa. She's getting restive. I must answer now. Delay is as
dangerous as the wrong answer.
Jessica said: "It's a maker --"
"Eighe-e-e-e-e-e!" Mapes wailed. It was a sound of both grief and elation.
She trembled so hard the knife blade sent glittering shards of reflection
shooting around the room.
Jessica waited, poised. She had intended to say the knife was a maker of
death and then add the ancient word, but every sense warned her now, all the
deep training of alertness that exposed meaning in the most casual muscle
twitch.
The key word was . . . maker.
Maker? Maker.
Still, Mapes held the knife as though ready to use it.
Jessica said: "Did you think that I, knowing the mysteries of the Great
Mother, would not know the Maker?"
Mapes lowered the knife. "My Lady, when one has lived with prophecy for so
long, the moment of revelation is a shock."
Jessica thought about the prophecy -- the Shari-a and all the panoplia
propheticus, a Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva dropped here long
centuries ago -- long dead, no doubt, but her purpose accomplished: the
protective legends implanted in these people against the day of a Bene
Gesserit's need.
Well, that day had come.
Mapes returned knife to sheath, said: "This is an unfixed blade, my Lady.
Keep it near you. More than a week away from flesh and it begins to
disintegrate. It's yours, a tooth of shai-hulud, for as long as you live."
Jessica reached out her right hand, risked a gamble: "Mapes, you've sheathed
that blade unblooded."
With a gasp, Mapes dropped the sheathed knife into Jessica's hand, tore open
the brown bodice, wailing: "Take the water of my life!"
Jessica withdrew the blade from its sheath. How it glittered! She directed
the point toward Mapes, saw a fear greater than death-panic come over the woman.

Poison in the point? Jessica wondered. She tipped up the point, drew a delicate
scratch with the blade's edge above Mapes' left breast. There was a thick
welling of blood that stopped almost immediately. Ultrafast coagulation, Jessica
thought. A moisture-conserving mutation?
She sheathed the blade, said: "Button your dress, Mapes."
Mapes obeyed, trembling. The eyes without whites stared at Jessica. "You are
ours," she muttered. "You are the One."
There came another sound of unloading in the entry. Swiftly, Mapes grabbed
the sheathed knife, concealed it in Jessica's bodice. "Who sees that knife must
be cleansed or slain!" she snarled. "You know that, my Lady!"
I know it now, Jessica thought.
The cargo handlers left without intruding on the Great Hall.
Mapes composed herself, said: "The uncleansed who have seen a crysknife may
not leave Arrakis alive. Never forget that, my Lady. You've been entrusted with
a crysknife." She took a deep breath. "Now the thing must take its course. It
cannot be hurried." She glanced at the stacked boxes and piled goods around
them. "And there's work aplenty to while the time for us here."
Jessica hesitated. "The thing must take its course." That was a specific
catchphrase from the Missionaria Protectiva's stock of incantations -- The
coming of the Reverend Mother to free you.
But I'm not a Reverend Mother, Jessica thought. And then: Great Mother! They
planted that one here! This must be a hideous place!
In matter-of-fact tones, Mapes said: "What'll you be wanting me to do first,
my Lady?"
Instinct warned Jessica to match that casual tone. She said: "The painting
of the Old Duke over there, it must be hung on one side of the dining hall. The
bull's head must go on the wall opposite the painting."
Mapes crossed to the bull's head. "What a great beast it must have been to
carry such a head," she said. She stooped. "I'll have to be cleaning this first,
won't I, my Lady?"
"No."
"But there's dirt caked on its horns."
"That's not dirt, Mapes. That's the blood of our Duke's father. Those horns
were sprayed with a transparent fixative within hours after this beast killed
the Old Duke."
Mapes stood up. "Ah, now!" she said.
"It's just blood," Jessica said. "Old blood at that. Get some help hanging
these now. The beastly things are heavy."
"Did you think the blood bothered me?" Mapes asked. "I'm of the desert and
I've seen blood aplenty."
"I . . . see that you have," Jessica said.
"And some of it my own," Mapes said. "More'n you drew with your puny
scratch."
"You'd rather I'd cut deeper?"
"Ah, no! The body's water is scant enough 'thout gushing a wasteful lot of
it into the air. You did the thing right."
And Jessica, noting the words and manner, caught the deeper implications in
the phrase, 'the body's water.' Again she felt a sense of oppression at the
importance of water on Arrakis.
"On which side of the dining hall shall I hang which one of these pretties,
my Lady?" Mapes asked.
Ever the practical one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. She said: "Use your own
judgment, Mapes. It makes no real difference."
"As you say, my Lady." Mapes stooped, began clearing wrappings and twine
from the head. "Killed an old duke, did you?" she crooned.
"Shall I summon a handler to help you?" Jessica asked.
"I'll manage, my Lady."
Yes, she'll manage, Jessica thought. There's that about this Fremen
creature: the drive to manage.
Jessica felt the cold sheath of the crysknife beneath her bodice, thought of
the long chain of Bene Gesserit scheming that had forged another link here.
Because of that scheming, she had survived a deadly crisis. "It cannot be
hurried," Mapes had said. Yet there was a tempo of headlong rushing to this
place that filled Jessica with foreboding. And not all the preparations of the
Missionaria Protectiva nor Hawat's suspicious inspection of this castellated
pile of rocks could dispel the feeling.
"When you've finished hanging those, start unpacking the boxes," Jessica
said. "One of the cargo men at the entry has all the keys and knows where things
should go. Get the keys and the list from him. If there are any questions I'll
be in the south wing."
"As you will, my Lady," Mapes said.
Jessica turned away, thinking: Hawat may have passed this residency as safe,
but there's something wrong about the place. I can feel it.
An urgent need to see her son gripped Jessica. She began walking toward the
arched doorway that led into the passage to the dining hall and the family
wings. Faster and faster she walked until she was almost running.
Behind her, Mapes paused in clearing the wrappings from the bull's head,
looked at the retreating back. "She's the One all right," she muttered. "Poor
thing."

"Yueh! Yueh! Yueh!" goes the refrain. "A million deaths were not enough for
Yueh!"
-from "A Child's History of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
The door stood ajar, and Jessica stepped through it into a room with yellow
walls. To her left stretched a low settee of black hide and two empty bookcases,
a hanging waterflask with dust on its bulging sides. To her right, bracketing
another door, stood more empty bookcases, a desk from Caladan and three chairs.
At the windows directly ahead of her stood Dr. Yueh, his back to her, his
attention fixed upon the outside world.
Jessica took another silent step into the room.
She saw that Yueh's coat was wrinkled, a white smudge near the left elbow as
though he had leaned against chalk. He looked, from behind, like a fleshless
stick figure in overlarge black clothing, a caricature poised for stringy
movement at the direction of a puppet master. Only the squarish block of head
with long ebony hair caught in its silver Suk School ring at the shoulder seemed
alive--turning slightly to follow some movement outside.
Again, she glanced around the room, seeing no sign of her son, but the
closed door on her right, she knew, let into a small bedroom for which Paul had
expressed a liking.
"Good afternoon. Dr. Yueh," she said. "Where's Paul?"
He nodded as though to something out the window, spoke in an absent manner
without turning: "Your son grew tired, Jessica. I sent him into the next room to
rest."
Abruptly, he stiffened, whirled with mustache flopping over his purpled
lips. "Forgive me, my Lady! My thoughts were far away . . . I . . . did not mean
to be familiar."
She smiled, held out her right hand. For a moment, she was afraid he might
kneel. "Wellington, please."
"To use your name like that . . . I . . . "
"We've known each other six years," she said. "It's long past time
formalities should've been dropped between us--in private."
Yueh ventured a thin smile, thinking: I believe it has worked. Now, she'll
think anything unusual in my manner is due to embarrassment. She'll not look for
deeper reasons when she believes she already knows the answer.
"I'm afraid I was woolgathering," he said. "Whenever I . . . feel especially
sorry for you. I'm afraid I think of you as . . . well, Jessica."
"Sorry for me? Whatever for?"
Yueh shrugged. Long ago, he had realized Jessica was not gifted with the
full Truthsay as his Wanna had been. Still, he always used the truth with
Jessica whenever possible. It was safest.
"You've seen this place, my . . . Jessica." He stumbled over the name,
plunged ahead: "So barren after Caladan. And the people! Those townswomen we
passed on the way here wailing beneath their veils. The way they looked at us."
She folded her arms across her breast, hugging herself, feeling the
crysknife there, a blade ground from a sandworm's tooth, if the reports were
right. "It's just that we're strange to them--different people, different
customs. They've known only the Harkonnens." She looked past him out the
windows. "What were you staring at out there?"
He turned back to the window. "The people."
Jessica crossed to his side, looked to the left toward the front of the
house where Yueh's attention was focused. A line of twenty palm trees grew
there, the ground beneath them swept clean, barren. A screen fence separated
them from the road upon which robed people were passing. Jessica detected a
faint shimmering in the air between her and the people--a house shield--and went
on to study the passing throng, wondering why Yueh found them so absorbing.
The pattern emerged and she put a hand to her cheek. The way the passing
people looked at the palm trees! She saw envy, some hate . . . even a sense of
hope. Each person raked those trees with a fixity of expression.
"Do you know what they're thinking?" Yueh asked.
"You profess to read minds?" she asked.
"Those minds," he said. "They look at those trees and they think; 'There are
one hundred of us.' That's what they think."
She turned a puzzled frown on him. "Why?"
"Those are date palms," he said. "One date palm requires forty liters of
water a day. A man requires but eight liters. A palm, then, equals five men.
There are twenty palms out there--one hundred men."
"But some of those people look at the trees hopefully."
"They but hope some dates will fall, except it's the wrong season."
"We look at this place with too critical an eye," she said. "There's hope as
well as danger here. The spice could make us rich. With a fat treasury, we can
make this world into whatever we wish."
And she laughed silently at herself: Who am I trying to convince? The laugh
broke through her restraints, emerging brittle, without humor. "But you can't
buy security," she said.
Yueh turned away to hide his face from her. If only it were possible to hate
these people instead of love them! In her manner, in many ways, Jessica was like
his Wanna. Yet that thought carried its own rigors, hardening him to his
purpose. The ways of the Harkonnen cruelty were devious. Wanna might not be
dead. He had to be certain.
"Do not worry for us, Wellington," Jessica said. "The problem's ours, not
yours."
She thinks I worry for her! He blinked back tears. And I do, of course. But
I must stand before that black Baron with his deed accomplished, and take my one
chance to strike him where he is weakest--in his gloating moment!
He sighed.
"Would it disturb Paul if I looked in on him?" she asked.
"Not at all. I gave him a sedative."
"He's taking the change well?" she asked.

"Except for getting a bit overtired. He's excited, but what fifteen-year-old
wouldn't be under these circumstances?" He crossed to the door, opened it. "He's
in here."
Jessica followed, peered into a shadowy room.
Paul lay on a narrow cot, one arm beneath a light cover, the other thrown
back over his head. Slatted blinds at a window beside the bed wove a loom of
shadows across face and blanket.
Jessica stared at her son, seeing the oval shape of face so like her own.
But the hair was the Duke's--coal-colored and tousled. Long lashes concealed the
lime-toned eyes. Jessica smiled, feeling her fears retreat. She was suddenly
caught by the idea of genetic traces in her son's features--her lines in eyes
and facial outline, but sharp touches of the father peering through that outline
like maturity emerging from childhood.
She thought of the boy's features as an exquisite distillation out of random
patterns--endless queues of happenstance meeting at this nexus. The thought made
her want to kneel beside the bed and take her son in her arms, but she was
inhibited by Yueh's presence. She stepped back, closed the door softly.
Yueh had returned to the window, unable to bear watching the way Jessica
stared at her son. Why did Wanna never give me children? he asked himself. I
know as a doctor there was no physical reason against it. Was there some Bene
Gesserit reason? Was she, perhaps, instructed to serve a different purpose? What
could it have been? She loved me, certainly.
For the first time, he was caught up in the thought that he might be part of
a pattern more involuted and complicated than his mind could grasp.
Jessica stopped beside him, said: "What delicious abandon in the sleep of a
child."
He spoke mechanically: "If only adults could relax like that."
"Yes."
"Where do we lose it?" he murmured.
She glanced at him, catching the odd tone, but her mind was still on Paul,
thinking of the new rigors in his training here, thinking of the differences in
his life now--so very different from the life they once had planned for him.
"We do, indeed, lose something," she said.
She glanced out to the right at a slope humped with a wind-troubled graygreen of bushes--dusty leaves and dry claw branches. The too-dark sky hung over
the slope like a blot, and the milky light of the Arrakeen sun gave the scene a
silver cast--light like the crysknife concealed in her bodice.
"The sky's so dark," she said.
"That's partly the lack of moisture," he said.
"Water!" she snapped. "Everywhere you turn here, you're involved with the
lack of water!"
"It's the precious mystery of Arrakis," he said.
"Why is there so little of it? There's volcanic rock here. There're a dozen
power sources I could name. There's polar ice. They say you can't drill in the
desert--storms and sandtides destroy equipment faster than it can be installed,
if the worms don't get you first. They've never found water traces there,
anyway. But the mystery, Wellington, the real mystery is the wells that've been
drilled up here in the sinks and basins. Have you read about those?"
"First a trickle, then nothing," he said.
"But, Wellington, that's the mystery. The water was there. It dries up. And
never again is there water. Yet another hole nearby produces the same result: a
trickle that stops. Has no one ever been curious about this?"
"It is curious," he said. "You suspect some living agency? Wouldn't that
have shown in core samples?"
"What would have shown? Alien plant matter . . . or animal? Who could
recognize it?" She turned back to the slope. "The water is stopped. Something
plugs it. That's my suspicion."
"Perhaps the reason's known," he said. "The Harkonnens sealed off many
sources of information about Arrakis. Perhaps there was reason to suppress
this."
"What reason?" she asked. "And then there's the atmospheric moisture. Little
enough of it, certainly, but there's some. It's the major source of water here,
caught in windtraps and precipitators. Where does that come from?"
"The polar caps?"
"Cold air takes up little moisture, Wellington. There are things here behind
the Harkonnen veil that bear close investigation, and not all of those things
are directly involved with the spice."
"We are indeed behind the Harkonnen veil," he said. "Perhaps we'll . . . "
He broke off, noting the sudden intense way she was looking at him. "Is
something wrong?"
"The way you say 'Harkonnen,' " she said. "Even my Duke's voice doesn't
carry that weight of venom when he uses the hated name. I didn't know you had
personal reasons to hate them, Wellington."
Great Mother! he thought. I've aroused her suspicions! Now I must use every
trick my Wanna taught me. There's only one solution: tell the truth as far as I
can.
He said: "You didn't know that my wife, my Wanna . . . " He shrugged, unable
to speak past a sudden constriction in his throat. Then: "They . . . " The words
would not come out. He felt panic, closed his eyes tightly, experiencing the
agony in his chest and little else until a hand touched his arm gently.
"Forgive me," Jessica said. "I did not mean to open an old wound." And she
thought: Those animals! His wife was Bene Gesserit--the signs are all over him.
And it's obvious the Harkonnens killed her. Here's another poor victim bound to
the Atreides by a cherem of hate.
"I am sorry," he said. "I'm unable to talk about it." He opened his eyes,
giving himself up to the internal awareness of grief. That, at least, was truth.
Jessica studied him, seeing the up-angled cheeks, the dark sequins of almond
eyes, the butter complexion, and stringy mustache hanging like a curved frame
around purpled lips and narrow chin. The creases of his cheeks and forehead, she
saw, were as much lines of sorrow as of age. A deep affection for him came over
her.
"Wellington, I'm sorry we brought you into this dangerous place," she said.
"I came willingly," he said. And that, too, was true.
"But this whole planet's a Harkonnen trap. You must know that."
"It will take more than a trap to catch the Duke Leto," he said. And that,
too, was true.
"Perhaps I should be more confident of him," she said. "He is a brilliant
tactician."
"We've been uprooted," he said. "That's why we're uneasy."
"And how easy it is to kill the uprooted plant," she said. "Especially when
you put it down in hostile soil."
"Are we certain the soil's hostile?"
"There were water riots when it was learned how many people the Duke was
adding to the population," she said. "They stopped only when the people learned
we were installing new windtraps and condensers to take care of the load."
"There is only so much water to support human life here," he said. "The
people know if more come to drink a limited amount of water, the price goes up
and the very poor die. But the Duke has solved this. It doesn't follow that the
riots mean permanent hostility toward him."
"And guards," she said. "Guards everywhere. And shields. You see the
blurring of them everywhere you look. We did not live this way on Caladan."
"Give this planet a chance," he said.
But Jessica continued to stare hard-eyed out the window. "I can smell death
in this place," she said. "Hawat sent advance agents in here by the battalion.

Those guards outside are his men. The cargo handlers are his men. There've been
unexplained withdrawals of large sums from the treasury. The amounts mean only
one thing: bribes in high places." She shook her head. "Where Thufir Hawat goes,
death and deceit follow."
"You malign him."
"Malign? I praise him. Death and deceit are our only hopes now. I just do
not fool myself about Thufir's methods."
"You should . . . keep busy," he said. "Give yourself no time for such
morbid--"
"Busy! What is it that takes most of my time, Wellington? I am the Duke's
secretary--so busy that each day I learn new things to fear . . . things even he
doesn't suspect I know." She compressed her lips, spoke thinly: "Sometimes I
wonder how much my Bene Gesserit business training figured in his choice of me."
"What do you mean?" He found himself caught by the cynical tone, the
bitterness that he had never seen her expose.
"Don't you think, Wellington," she asked, "that a secretary bound to one by
love is so much safer?"
"That is not a worthy thought, Jessica."
The rebuke came naturally to his lips. There was no doubt how the Duke felt
about his concubine. One had only to watch him as he followed her with his eyes.
She sighed. "You're right. It's not worthy."
Again, she hugged herself, pressing the sheathed crysknife against her flesh
and thinking of the unfinished business it represented.
"There'll be much bloodshed soon," she said. "The Harkonnens won't rest
until they're dead or my Duke destroyed. The Baron cannot forget that Leto is a
cousin of the royal blood--no matter what the distance--while the Harkonnen
titles came out of the CHOAM pocketbook. But the poison in him, deep in his
mind, is the knowledge that an Atreides had a Harkonnen banished for cowardice
after, the Battle of Corrin."
"The old feud," Yueh muttered. And for a moment he felt an acid touch of
hate. The old feud had trapped him in its web, killed his Wanna or--worse--left
her for Harkonnen tortures until her husband did their bidding. The old feud had
trapped him and these people were part of that poisonous thing. The irony was
that such deadliness should come to flower here on Arrakis, the one source in
the universe of melange, the prolonger of life, the giver of health.
"What are you thinking?" she asked.
"I am thinking that the spice brings six hundred and twenty thousand Solaris
the decagram on the open market right now. That is wealth to buy many things."
"Does greed touch even you, Wellington?"
"Not greed."
"What then?"
He shrugged. "Futility." He glanced at her. "Can you remember your first
taste of spice?"
"It tasted like cinnamon."
"But never twice the same," he said. "It's like life--it presents a
different face each time you take it. Some hold that the spice produces a
learned-flavor reaction. The body, learning a thing is good for it, interprets
the flavor as pleasurable--slightly euphoric. And, like life, never to be truly
synthesized."
"I think it would've been wiser for us to go renegade, to take ourselves
beyond the Imperial reach," she said.
He saw that she hadn't been listening to him, focused on her words,
wondering: Yes--why didn't she make him do this? She could make him do virtually
anything.
He spoke quickly because here was truth and a change of subject: "Would you
think it bold of me . . . Jessica, if I asked a personal question?"
She pressed against the window ledge in an unexplainable pang of disquiet.
"Of course not. You're . . . my friend."
"Why haven't you made the Duke marry you?"
She whirled, head up, glaring. "Made him marry me? But--"
"I should not have asked," he said.
"No." She shrugged. "There's good political reason--as long as my Duke
remains unmarried some of the Great Houses can still hope for alliance. And . .
. " She sighed. " . . . motivating people, forcing them to your will, gives you
a cynical attitude toward humanity. It degrades everything it touches. If I made
him do . . . this, then it would not be his doing."
"It's a thing my Wanna might have said," he murmured. And this, too, was
truth. He put a hand to his mouth, swallowing convulsively. He had never been
closer to speaking out, confessing his secret role.
Jessica spoke, shattering the moment. "Besides, Wellington, the Duke is
really two men. One of them I love very much. He's charming, witty, considerate
. . . tender--everything a woman could desire. But the other man is . . . cold,
callous, demanding, selfish--as harsh and cruel as a winter wind. That's the man
shaped by the father." Her face contorted. "If only that old man had died when
my Duke was born!"
In the silence that came between them, a breeze from a ventilator could be
heard fingering the blinds.
Presently, she took a deep breath, said, "Leto's right--these rooms are
nicer than the ones in the other sections of the house." She turned, sweeping
the room with her gaze. "If you'll excuse me, Wellington, I want another look
through this wing before I assign quarters."
He nodded. "Of course." And he thought: if only there were some way not to
do this thing that I must do.
Jessica dropped her arms, crossed to the hall door and stood there a moment,
hesitating, then let herself out. All the time we talked he was hiding
something, holding something back, she thought. To save my feelings, no doubt.
He's a good man. Again, she hesitated, almost turned back to confront Yueh and
drag the hidden thing from him. But that would only shame him, frighten him to
learn he's so easily read. I should place more trust in my friends.

Many have marked the speed with which Muad'Dib learned the necessities of
Arrakis. The Bene Gesserit, of course, know the basis of this speed. For the
others, we can say that Muad'Dib learned rapidly because his first training was
in how to learn. And the first lesson of all was the basic trust that he could
learn. It is shocking to find how many people do not believe they can learn, and
how many more believe learning to be difficult. Muad'Dib knew that every
experience carries its lesson.
-from "The Humanity of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
Paul lay on the bed feigning sleep. It had been easy to palm Dr. Yueh's
sleeping tablet, to pretend to swallow it. Paul suppressed a laugh. Even his
mother had believed him asleep. He had wanted to jump up and ask her permission
to go exploring the house, but had realized she wouldn't approve. Things were
too unsettled yet. No. This way was best.
If I slip out without asking I haven't disobeyed orders. And I will stay in
the house where it's safe.
He heard his mother and Yueh talking in the other room. Their words were
indistinct--something about the spice . . . the Harkonnens. The conversation
rose and fell.
Paul's attention went to the carved headboard of his bed--a false headboard
attached to the wall and concealing the controls for this room's functions. A
leaping fish had been shaped on the wood with thick brown waves beneath it. He
knew if he pushed the fish's one visible eye that would turn on the room's
suspensor lamps. One of the waves, when twisted, controlled ventilation. Another
changed the temperature.
Quietly, Paul sat up in bed. A tall bookcase stood against the wall to his
left. It could be swung aside to reveal a closet with drawers along one side.
The handle on the door into the hall was patterned on an ornithopter thrust bar.
It was as though the room had been designed to entice him.
The room and this planet.
He thought of the filmbook Yueh had shown him--"Arrakis: His Imperial
Majesty's Desert Botanical Testing Station." It was an old filmbook from before
discovery of the spice. Names flitted through Paul's mind, each with its picture
imprinted by the book's mnemonic pulse: saguaro, burro bush, date palm, sand
verbena, evening primrose, barrel cactus, incense bush, smoke tree, creosote
bush . . . kit fox, desert hawk, kangaroo mouse . . .
Names and pictures, names and pictures from man's terranic past--and many to
be found now nowhere else in the universe except here on Arrakis.
So many new things to learn about--the spice.
And the sandworms.
A door closed in the other room. Paul heard his mother's footsteps
retreating down the hall. Dr. Yueh, he knew, would find something to read and
remain in the other room.
Now was the moment to go exploring.
Paul slipped out of the bed, headed for the bookcase door that opened into
the closet. He stopped at a sound behind him, turned. The carved headboard of
the bed was folding down onto the spot where he had been sleeping. Paul froze,
and immobility saved his life.
From behind the headboard slipped a tiny hunter-seeker no more than five
centimeters long. Paul recognized it at once--a common assassination weapon that
every child of royal blood learned about at an early age. It was a ravening
sliver of metal guided by some near-by hand and eye. It could burrow into moving
flesh and chew its way up nerve channels to the nearest vital organ.
The seeker lifted, swung sideways across the room and back.
Through Paul's mind flashed the related knowledge, the hunter-seeker
limitations: Its compressed suspensor field distorted the vision of its
transmitter eye. With nothing but the dim light of the room to reflect his
target, the operator would be relying on motion--anything that moved. A shield
could slow a hunter, give time to destroy it, but Paul had put aside his shield
on the bed. Lasguns would knock them down, but lasguns were expensive and
notoriously cranky of maintenance--and there was always the peril of explosive
pyrotechnics if the laser beam intersected a hot shield. The Atreides relied on
their body shields and their wits.
Now, Paul held himself in near catatonic immobility, knowing he had only his
wits to meet this threat.
The hunter-seeker lifted another half meter. It rippled through the slatted
light from the window blinds, back and forth, quartering the room.
I must try to grab it, he thought. The suspensor field will make it slippery
on the bottom. I must grip tightly.
The thing dropped a half meter, quartered to the left, circled back around
the bed. A faint humming could be heard from it.
Who is operating that thing? Paul wondered. It has to be someone near. I
could shout for Yueh, but it would take him the instant the door opened.
The hall door behind Paul creaked. A rap sounded there. The door opened.
The hunter-seeker arrowed past his head toward the motion.
Paul's right hand shot out and down, gripping the deadly thing. It hummed
and twisted in his hand, but his muscles were locked on it in desperation. With
a violent turn and thrust, he slammed the thing's nose against the metal
doorplate. He felt the crunch of it as the nose eye smashed and the seeker went
dead in his hand.
Still, he held it--to be certain.
Paul's eyes came up, met the open stare of total blue from the Shadout
Mapes.
"Your father has sent for you," she said. "There are men in the hall to
escort you."
Paul nodded, his eyes and awareness focusing on this odd woman in a sacklike dress of bondsman brown. She was looking now at the thing clutched in his
hand.
"I've heard of suchlike," she said. "It would've killed me, not so?"
He had to swallow before he could speak. "I . . . was its target."
"But it was coming for me."
"Because you were moving." And he wondered: Who is this creature?
"Then you saved my life," she said.
"I saved both our lives."
"Seems like you could've let it have me and made your own escape," she said.
"Who are you?" he asked.
"The Shadout Mapes, housekeeper."
"How did you know where to find me?"
"Your mother told me. I met her at the stairs to the weirding room down the
hall." She pointed to her right. "Your father's men are still waiting."
Those will be Hawat's men, he thought. We must find the operator of this
thing.
"Go to my father's men," he said. "Tell them I've caught a hunter-seeker in
the house and they're to spread out and find the operator. Tell them to seal off
the house and its grounds immediately. They'll know how to go about it. The
operator's sure to be a stranger among us."
And he wondered: Could it be this creature? But he knew it wasn't. The
seeker had been under control when she entered.
"Before I do your bidding, manling," Mapes said, "I must cleanse the way
between us. You've put a water burden on me that I'm not sure I care to support.
But we Fremen pay our debts--be they black debts or white debts. And it's known
to us that you've a traitor in your midst. Who it is, we cannot say, but we're
certain sure of it. Mayhap there's the hand guided that flesh-cutter."
Paul absorbed this in silence: a traitor. Before he could speak, the odd
woman whirled away and ran back toward the entry.
He thought to call her back, but there was an air about her that told him
she would resent it. She'd told him what she knew and now she was going to do
his bidding. The house would be swarming with Hawat's men in a minute.
His mind went to other parts of that strange conversation: weirding room. He
looked to his left where she had pointed. We Fremen. So that was a Fremen. He
paused for the mnemonic blink that would store the pattern of her face in his
memory--prune-wrinkled features darkly browned, blue-on-blue eyes without any
white in them. He attached the label: The Shadout Mapes.
Still gripping the shattered seeker, Paul turned back into his room, scooped
up his shield belt from the bed with his left hand, swung it around his waist
and buckled it as he ran back out and down the hall to the left.
She'd said his mother was someplace down here--stairs . . . a weirding room.

What had the Lady Jessica to sustain her in her time of trial? Think you
carefully on this Bene Gesserit proverb and perhaps you will see: "Any road
followed precisely to its end leads precisely nowhere. Climb the mountain just a
little bit to test that it's a mountain. From the top of the mountain, you
cannot see the mountain."
-from "Muad'Dib: Family Commentaries" by the Princess Irulan
At the end of the south wing, Jessica found a metal stair spiraling up to an
oval door. She glanced back down the hall, again up at the door.
Oval? she wondered. What an odd shape for a door in a house.
Through the windows beneath the spiral stair she could see the great white
sun of Arrakis moving on toward evening. Long shadows stabbed down the hall. She
returned her attention to the stairs. Harsh sidelighting picked out bits of
dried earth on the open metalwork of the steps.
Jessica put a hand on the rail, began to climb. The rail felt cold under her
sliding palm. She stopped at the door, saw it had no handle, but there was a
faint depression on the surface of it where a handle should have been.
Surely not a palm lock, she told herself. A palm lock must be keyed to one
individual's hand shape and palm lines. But it looked like a palm lock. And
there were ways to open any palm lock--as she had learned at school.
Jessica glanced back to make certain she was unobserved, placed her palm
against the depression in the door. The most gentle of pressures to distort the
lines--a turn of the wrist, another turn, a sliding twist of the palm across the
surface.
She felt the click.
But there were hurrying footsteps in the hall beneath her. Jessica lifted
her hand from the door, turned, saw Mapes come to the foot of the stairs.
"There are men in the great hall say they've been sent by the Duke to get
young master Paul," Mapes said. "They've the ducal signet and the guard has
identified them." She glanced at the door, back to Jessica.
A cautious one, this Mapes, Jessica thought. That's a good sign.
"He's in the fifth room from this end of the hall, the small bedroom,"
Jessica said. "If you have trouble waking him, call on Dr. Yueh in the next
room. Paul may require a wakeshot."
Again, Mapes cast a piercing stare at the oval door, and Jessica thought she
detected loathing in the expression. Before Jessica could ask about the door and
what it concealed, Mapes had turned away, hurrying back down the hall.
Hawat certified this place, Jessica thought. There can't be anything too
terrible in here.
She pushed the door. It swung inward onto a small room with another oval
door opposite. The other door had a wheel handle.
An airlock! Jessica thought. She glanced down, saw a door prop fallen to the
floor of the little room. The prop carried Hawat's personal mark. The door was
left propped open, she thought. Someone probably knocked the prop down
accidentally, not realizing the outer door would close on a palm lock.
She stepped over the lip into the little room.
Why an airlock in a house? she asked herself. And she thought suddenly of
exotic creatures sealed off in special climates.
Special climate!
That would make sense on Arrakis where even the driest of off-planet growing
things had to be irrigated.
The door behind her began swinging closed. She caught it and propped it open
securely with the stick Hawat had left. Again, she faced the wheel-locked inner
door, seeing now a faint inscription etched in the metal above the handle. She
recognized Galach words, read:
"O, Man! Here is a lovely portion of God's Creation; then, stand before it
and learn to love the perfection of Thy Supreme Friend."
Jessica put her weight on the wheel. It turned left and the inner door
opened. A gentle draft feathered her cheek, stirred her hair. She felt change in
the air, a richer taste. She swung the door wide, looked through into massed
greenery with yellow sunlight pouring across it.
A yellow sun? she asked herself. Then: Filter glass!

She stepped over the sill and the door swung closed behind.
"A wet-planet conservatory," she breathed:
Potted plants and low-pruned trees stood all about. She recognized a mimosa,
a flowering quince, a sondagi, green-blossomed pleniscenta, green and white
striped akarso . . . roses . . .
Even roses!
She bent to breathe the fragrance of a giant pink blossom, straightened to
peer around the room.
Rhythmic noise invaded her senses.
She parted a jungle overlapping of leaves, looked through to the center of
the room. A low fountain stood there, small with fluted lips. The rhythmic noise
was a peeling, spooling arc of water falling thud-a-gallop onto the metal bowl.
Jessica sent herself through the quick sense-clearing regimen, began a
methodical inspection of the room's perimeter. It appeared to be about ten
meters square. From its placement above the end of the hall and from subtle
differences in construction, she guessed it had been added onto the roof of this
wing long after the original building's completion.
She stopped at the south limits of the room in front of the wide reach of
filter glass, stared around. Every available space in the room was crowded with
exotic wet-climate plants. Something rustled in the greenery. She tensed, then
glimpsed a simple clock-set servok with pipe and hose arms. An arm lifted, sent
out a fine spray of dampness that misted her cheeks. The arm retracted and she
looked at what it had watered: a fern tree.
Water everywhere in this room--on a planet where water was the most precious
juice of life. Water being wasted so conspicuously that it shocked her to inner
stillness.
She glanced out at the filter-yellowed sun. It hung low on a jagged horizon
above cliffs that formed part of the immense rock uplifting known as the Shield
Wall.
Filter glass, she thought. To turn a white sun into something softer and
more familiar. Who could have built such a place? Leto? It would be like him to
surprise me with such a gift, but there hasn't been time. And he's been busy
with more serious problems.
She recalled the report that many Arrakeen houses were sealed by airlock
doors and windows to conserve and reclaim interior moisture. Leto had said it
was a deliberate statement of power and wealth for this house to ignore such
precautions, its doors and windows being sealed only against the omnipresent
dust.
But this room embodied a statement far more significant than the lack of
waterseals on outer doors. She estimated that this pleasure room used water
enough to support a thousand persons on Arrakis--possibly more.
Jessica moved along the window, continuing to stare into the room. The move
brought into view a metallic surface at table height beside the fountain and she
glimpsed a white notepad and stylus there partly concealed by an overhanging fan
leaf. She crossed to the table, noted Hawat's daysigns on it, studied a message
written on the pad:
"TO THE LADY JESSICA-May this place give you as much pleasure as it has given me. Please permit the
room to convey a lesson we learned from the same teachers: the proximity of a
desirable thing tempts one to overindulgence. On that path lies danger.
My kindest wishes,
MARGOT LADY FENRING"
Jessica nodded, remembering that Leto had referred to the Emperor's former
proxy here as Count Fenring. But the hidden message of the note demanded
immediate attention, couched as it was in a way to inform her the writer was
another Bene Gesserit. A bitter thought touched Jessica in passing: The Count
married his Lady.
Even as this thought flicked through her mind, she was bending to seek out
the hidden message. It had to be there. The visible note contained the code
phrase every Bene Gesserit not bound by a School Injunction was required to give
another Bene Gesserit when conditions demanded it: "On that path lies danger."
Jessica felt the back of the note, rubbed the surface for coded dots.
Nothing. The edge of the pad came under her seeking fingers. Nothing. She
replaced the pad where she had found it, feeling a sense of urgency.
Something in the position of the pad? she wondered.
But Hawat had been over this room, doubtless had moved the pad. She looked
at the leaf above the pad. The leaf! She brushed a finger along the under
surface, along the edge, along the stem. It was there! Her fingers detected the
subtle coded dots, scanned them in a single passage:
"Your son and Duke are in immediate danger. A bedroom has been designed to
attract your son. The H loaded it with death traps to be discovered, leaving one
that may escape detection." Jessica put down the urge to run back to Paul; the
full message had to be learned. Her fingers sped over the dots; "I do not know
the exact nature of the menace, but it has something to do with a bed. The
threat to your Duke involves defection of a trusted companion or lieutenant. The
H plan to give you as gift to a minion. To the best of my knowledge, this
conservatory is safe. Forgive that I cannot tell more. My sources are few as my
Count is not in the pay of the H. In haste, MF."
Jessica thrust the leaf aside, whirled to dash back to Paul. In that
instant, the airlock door slammed open. Paul jumped through it, holding
something in his right hand, slammed the door behind him. He saw his mother,
pushed through the leaves to her, glanced at the fountain, thrust his hand and
the thing it clutched under the falling water.
"Paul!" She grabbed his shoulder, staring at the hand. "What is that?"
He spoke casually, but she caught the effort behind the tone: "Hunterseeker. Caught it in my room and smashed its nose, but I want to be sure. Water
should short it out."
"Immerse it!" she commanded.
He obeyed.
Presently, she said: "Withdraw your hand. Leave the thing in the water."
He brought out his hand, shook water from it, staring at the quiescent metal
in the fountain. Jessica broke off a plant stem, prodded the deadly sliver.
It was dead.
She dropped the stem into the water, looked at Paul. His eyes studied the
room with a searching intensity that she recognized--the B.G. Way.
"This place could conceal anything," he said.
"I've reason to believe it's safe," she said.
"My room was supposed to be safe, too. Hawat said--"
"It was a hunter-seeker," she reminded him "That means someone inside the
house to operate it. Seeker control beams have a limited range. The thing
could've been spirited in here after Hawat's investigation."
But she thought of the message of the leaf: " . . . defection of a trusted
companion or lieutenant." Not Hawat, surely. Oh, surely not Hawat.
"Hawat's men are searching the house right now," he said. "That seeker
almost got the old woman who came to wake me."
"The Shadout Mapes," Jessica said, remembering the encounter at the stairs.
"A summons from your father to--"
"That can wait," Paul said. "Why do you think this room's safe?"
She pointed to the note, explained about it.
He relaxed slightly.
But Jessica remained inwardly tense, thinking: A hunter-seeker! Merciful
Mother! It took all her training to prevent a fit of hysterical trembling.

Paul spoke matter of factly: "It's the Harkonnens, of course. We shall have
to destroy them."
A rapping sounded at the airlock door--the code knock of one of Hawat's
corps.
"Come in," Paul called.
The door swung wide and a tall man in Atreides uniform with a Hawat insignia
on his cap leaned into the room. "There you are, sir," he said. "The housekeeper
said you'd be here." He glanced around the room. "We found a cairn in the cellar
and caught a man in it. He had a seeker console."
"I'll want to take part in the interrogation," Jessica said.
"Sorry, my Lady. We messed him up catching him. He died."
"Nothing to identify him?" she asked.
"We've found nothing yet, my Lady."
"Was he an Arrakeen native?" Paul asked.
Jessica nodded at the astuteness of the question.
"He has the native look," the man said. "Put into that cairn more'n a month
ago, by the look, and left there to await our coming. Stone and mortar where he
came through into the cellar were untouched when we inspected the place
yesterday. I'll stake my reputation on it."
"No one questions your thoroughness," Jessica said.
"I question it, my Lady. We should've used sonic probes down there."
"I presume that's what you're doing now," Paul said.
"Yes, sir."
"Send word to my father that we'll be delayed."
"At once, sir." He glanced at Jessica. "It's Hawat's order that under such
circumstances as these the young master be guarded in a safe place." Again, his
eyes swept the room. "What of this place?"
"I've reason to believe it safe," she said. "Both Hawat and I have inspected
it."
"Then I'll mount guard outside here, m'Lady, until we've been over the house
once more." He bowed, touched his cap to Paul, backed out and swung the door
closed behind him.
Paul broke the sudden silence, saying: "Had we better go over the house
later ourselves? Your eyes might see things others would miss."
"This wing was the only place I hadn't examined," she said. "I put if off to
last because . . . "
"Because Hawat gave it his personal attention," he said.
She darted a quick look at his face, questioning.
"Do you distrust Hawat?" she asked.
"No, but he's getting old . . . he's overworked. We could take some of the
load from him."
"That'd only shame him and impair his efficiency," she said. "A stray insect
won't be able to wander into this wing after he hears about this. He'll be
shamed that . . . "
"We must take our own measures," he said.
"Hawat has served three generations of Atreides with honor," she said. "He
deserves every respect and trust we can pay him . . . many times over."
Paul said: "When my father is bothered by something you've done he says
'Bene Gesserit!' like a swear word."
"And what is it about me that bothers your father?"
"When you argue with him."
"You are not your father, Paul."
And Paul thought: It'll worry her, but I must tell her what that Mapes woman
said about a traitor among us.
"What're you holding back?" Jessica asked. "This isn't like you, Paul."
He shrugged, recounted the exchange with Mapes.

And Jessica thought of the message of the leaf. She came to sudden decision,
showed Paul the leaf, told him its message.
"My father must learn of this at once," he said. "I'll radiograph it in code
and get if off."
"No," she said. "You will wait until you can see him alone. As few as
possible must learn about it."
"Do you mean we should trust no one?"
"There's another possibility," she said. "This message may have been meant
to get to us. The people who gave it to us may believe it's true, but it may be
that the only purpose was to get this message to us."
Paul's face remained sturdily somber. "To sow distrust and suspicion in our
ranks, to weaken us that way," he said.
"You must tell your father privately and caution him about this aspect of
it, " she said.
"I understand."
She turned to the tall reach of filter glass, stared out to the southwest
where the sun of Arrakis was sinking--a yellowed ball above the cliffs.
Paul turned with her, said: "I don't think it's Hawat, either. Is it
possible it's Yueh?"
"He's not a lieutenant or companion," she said. "And I can assure you he
hates the Harkonnens as bitterly as we do."
Paul directed his attention to the cliffs, thinking: And it couldn't be
Gurney . . . or Duncan. Could it be one of the sub-lieutenants? Impossible.
They're all from families that've been loyal to us for generations--for good
reason.
Jessica rubbed her forehead, sensing her own fatigue. So much peril here!
She looked out at the filter-yellowed landscape, studying it. Beyond the ducal
grounds stretched a high-fenced storage yard--lines of spice silos in it with
stilt-legged watchtowers standing around it like so many startled spiders. She
could see at least twenty storage yards of silos reaching out to the cliffs of
the Shield Wall--silos repeated, stuttering across the basin.
Slowly, the filtered sun buried itself beneath the horizon. Stars leaped
out. She saw one bright star so low on the horizon that it twinkled with a
clear, precise rhythm--a trembling of light: blink-blink-blink-blink-blink . . .
Paul stirred beside her in the dusky room.
But Jessica concentrated on that single bright star, realizing that it was
too low, that it must come from the Shield Wall cliffs.
Someone signaling!
She tried to read the message, but it was in no code she had ever learned.
Other lights had come on down on the plain beneath the cliffs: little
yellows spaced out against blue darkness. And one light off to their left grew
brighter, began to wink back at the cliff--very fast: blinksquirt, glimmer,
blink!
And it was gone.
The false star in the cliff winked out immediately.
Signals . . . and they filled her with premonition.
Why were lights used to signal across the basin? she asked herself. Why
couldn't they use the communications network?
The answer was obvious: the communinet was certain to be tapped now by
agents of the Duke Leto. Light signals could only mean that messages were being
sent between his enemies--between Harkonnen agents.
There came a tapping at the door behind them and the voice of Hawat's man;
"All clear, sir . . . m'Lady. Time to be getting the young master to his
father."

It is said that the Duke Leto blinded himself to the perils of Arrakis, that he
walked heedlessly into the pit. Would it not be more likely to suggest he had
lived so long in the presence of extreme danger he misjudged a change in its
intensity? Or is it possible he deliberately sacrificed himself that his son
might find a better life? All evidence indicates the Duke was a man not easily
hoodwinked.
-from "Muad'Dib: Family Commentaries" by the Princess Irulan
The Duke Leto Atreides leaned against a parapet of the landing control tower
outside Arrakeen. The night's first moon, an oblate silver coin, hung well above
the southern horizon. Beneath it, the jagged cliffs of the Shield Wall shone
like parched icing through a dust haze. To his left, the lights of Arrakeen
glowed in the haze--yellow . . . white . . . blue.
He thought of the notices posted now above his signature all through the
populous places of the planet: "Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has charged me to
take possession of this planet and end all dispute."
The ritualistic formality of it touched him with a feeling of loneliness.
Who was fooled by that fatuous legalism? Not the Fremen, certainly. Nor the
Houses Minor who controlled the interior trade of Arrakis . . . and were
Harkonnen creatures almost to a man.
They have tried to take the life of my son!
The rage was difficult to suppress.
He saw lights of a moving vehicle coming toward the landing field from
Arrakeen. He hoped it was the guard and troop carrier bringing Paul. The delay
was galling even though he knew it was prompted by caution on the part of
Hawat's lieutenant.
They have tried to take the life of my son!
He shook his head to drive out the angry thoughts, glanced back at the field
where five of his own frigates were posted around the rim like monolithic
sentries.
Better a cautious delay than . . .
The lieutenant was a good one, he reminded himself. A man marked for
advancement, completely loyal.
"Our Sublime Padishah Emperor . . . "
If the people of this decadent garrison city could only see the Emperor's
private note to his "Noble Duke"--the disdainful allusions to veiled men and
women: " . . . but what else is one to expect of barbarians whose dearest dream
is to live outside the ordered security of the faufreluches?"
The Duke felt in this moment that his own dearest dream was to end all class
distinctions and never again think of deadly order. He looked up and out of the
dust at the unwinking stars, thought: Around one of those little lights circles
Caladan . . . but I'll never again see my home. The longing for Caladan was a
sudden pain in his breast. He felt that it did not come from within himself, but
that it reached out to him from Caladan. He could not bring himself to call this
dry wasteland of Arrakis his home, and he doubted he ever would.
I must mask my feelings, he thought. For the boy's sake. If ever he's to
have a home, this must be it. I may think of Arrakis as a hell I've reached
before death, but he must find here that which will inspire him. There must be
something.
A wave of self-pity, immediately despised and rejected, swept through him,
and for some reason he found himself recalling two lines from a poem Gurney
Halleck often repeated-"My lungs taste the air of Time
Blown past falling sands . . . "
Well, Gurney would find plenty of falling sands here, the Duke thought. The
central wastelands beyond those moon-frosted cliffs were desert--barren rock,
dunes, and blowing dust, an uncharted dry wilderness with here and there along
its rim and perhaps scattered through it, knots of Fremen. If anything could buy
a future for the Atreides line, the Fremen just might do it.
Provided the Harkonnens hadn't managed to infect even the Fremen with their
poisonous schemes.
They have tried to take the life of my son!
A scraping metal racket vibrated through the tower, shook the parapet
beneath his arms. Blast shutters dropped in front of him, blocking the view.
Shuttle's coming in, he thought. Time to go down and get to work. He turned
to the stairs behind him, headed down to the big assembly room, trying to remain
calm as he descended, to prepare his face for the coming encounter.
They have tried to take the life of my son!
The men were already boiling in from the field when he reached the yellowdomed room. They carried their spacebags over their shoulders, shouting and
roistering like students returning from vacation.
"Hey! Feel that under your dogs? That's gravity, man!" "How many G's does
this place pull? Feels heavy." "Nine-tenths of a G by the book."
The crossfire of thrown words filled the big room.
"Did you get a good look at this hole on the way down? Where's all the loot
this place's supposed to have?" "The Harkonnens took it with 'em!" "Me for a hot
shower and a soft bed!" "Haven't you heard, stupid? No showers down here. You
scrub your ass with sand!" "Hey! Can it! The Duke!"
The Duke stepped out of the stair entry into a suddenly silent room.
Gurney Halleck strode along at the point of the crowd, bag over one
shoulder, the neck of his nine-string baliset clutched in the other hand. They
were long-fingered hands with big thumbs, full of tiny movements that drew such
delicate music from the baliset.
The Duke watched Halleck, admiring the ugly lump of a man, noting the glasssplinter eyes with their gleam of savage understanding. Here was a man who lived
outside the faufreluches while obeying their every precept. What was it Paul had
called him?
"Gurney, the valorous."
Halleck's wispy blond hair trailed across barren spots on his head. His wide
mouth was twisted into a pleasant sneer, and the scar of the inkvine whip
slashed across his jawline seemed to move with a life of its own. His whole air
was of casual, shoulder-set capability. He came up to the Duke, bowed.
"Gurney," Leto said.
"My Lord." He gestured with the baliset toward the men in the room. "This is
the last of them. I'd have preferred coming in with the first wave, but . . . "
"There are still some Harkonnens for you," the Duke said. "Step aside with
me, Gurney, where we may talk."
"Yours to command, my Lord."
They moved into an alcove beside a coil-slot water machine while the men
stirred restlessly in the big room. Halleck dropped his bag into a corner, kept
his grip on the baliset.
"How many men can you let Hawat have?" the Duke asked.
"Is Thufir in trouble. Sire?"
"He's lost only two agents, but his advance men gave us an excellent line on
the entire Harkonnen setup here. If we move fast we may gain a measure of
security, the breathing space we require. He wants as many men as you can spare-men who won't balk at a little knife work."
"I can let him have three hundred of my best," Halleck said. "Where shall I
send them?"
"To the main gate. Hawat has an agent there waiting to take them."
"Shall I get about it at once, Sire?"
"In a moment. We have another problem. The field commandant will hold the
shuttle here until dawn on a pretext. The Guild Heighliner that brought us is
going on about its business, and the shuttle's supposed to make contact with a
cargo ship taking up a load of spice."
"Our spice, m'Lord?"
"Our spice. But the shuttle also will carry some of the spice hunters from
the old regime. They've opted to leave with the change of fief and the Judge of
the Change is allowing it. These are valuable workers, Gurney, about eight
hundred of them. Before the shuttle leaves, you must persuade some of those men
to enlist with us."
"How strong a persuasion, Sire?"
"I want their willing cooperation, Gurney. Those men have experience and
skills we need. The fact that they're leaving suggests they're not part of the
Harkonnen machine. Hawat believes there could be some bad ones planted in the
group, but he sees assassins in every shadow."
"Thufir has found some very productive shadows in his time, m'Lord."
"And there are some he hasn't found. But I think planting sleepers in this
outgoing crowd would show too much imagination for the Harkonnens."
"Possibly, Sire. Where are these men?"
"Down on the lower level, in a waiting room. I suggest you go down and play
a tune or two to soften their minds, then turn on the pressure. You may offer
positions of authority to those who qualify. Offer twenty per cent higher wages
than they received under the Harkonnens."
"No more than that, Sire? I know the Harkonnen pay scales. And to men with
their termination pay in their pockets and the wanderlust on them . . . well.
Sire, twenty per cent would hardly seem proper inducement to stay."
Leto spoke impatiently: "Then use your own discretion in particular cases.
Just remember that the treasury isn't bottomless. Hold it to twenty per cent
whenever you can. We particularly need spice drivers, weather scanners, dune
men--any with open sand experience."
"I understand, Sire. 'They shall come all for violence: their faces shall
sup up as the east wind, and they shall gather the captivity of the sand.' "
"A very moving quotation," the Duke said. "Turn your crew over to a
lieutenant. Have him give a short drill on water discipline, then bed the men
down for the night in the barracks adjoining the field. Field personnel will
direct them. And don't forget the men for Hawat."
"Three hundred of the best, Sire." He took up his spacebag. "Where shall I
report to you when I've completed my chores?"
"I've taken over a council room topside here. We'll hold staff there. I want
to arrange a new planetary dispersal order with armored squads going out first."
Halleck stopped in the act of turning away, caught Leto's eye. "Are you
anticipating that kind of trouble, Sire? I thought there was a Judge of the
Change here."
"Both open battle and secret," the Duke said. "There'll be blood aplenty
spilled here before we're through."
" 'And the water which thou takest out of the river shall become blood upon
the dry land,' " Halleck quoted.
The Duke sighed. "Hurry back, Gurney."
"Very good, m'Lord." The whipscar rippled to his grin. " 'Behold, as a wild
ass in the desert, go I forth to my work.' " He turned, strode to the center of
the room, paused to relay his orders, hurried on through the men.
Leto shook his head at the retreating back. Halleck was a continual
amazement--a head full of songs, quotations, and flowery phrases . . . and the
heart of an assassin when it came to dealing with the Harkonnens.
Presently, Leto took a leisurely diagonal course across to the lift,
acknowledging salutes with a casual hand wave. He recognized a propaganda
corpsman, stopped to give him a message that could be relayed to the men through
channels: those who had brought their women would want to know the women were
safe and where they could be found. The others would wish to know that the
population here appeared to boast more women than men.
The Duke slapped the propaganda man on the arm, a signal that the message
had top priority to be put out immediately, then continued across the room. He
nodded to the men, smiled, traded pleasantries with a subaltern.
Command must always look confident, he thought. All that faith riding on
your shoulders while you sit in the critical seat and never show it.
He breathed a sigh of relief when the lift swallowed him and he could turn
and face the impersonal doors.
They have tried to take the life of my son!

Over the exit of the Arrakeen landing field, crudely carved as though with a
poor instrument, there was an inscription that Muad'Dib was to repeat many
times. He saw it that first night on Arrakis, having been brought to the ducal
command post to participate in his father's first full staff conference. The
words of the inscription were a plea to those leaving Arrakis, but they fell
with dark import on the eyes of a boy who had just escaped a close brush with
death. They said: "O you who know what we suffer here, do not forget us in your
prayers. "
-from "Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
"The whole theory of warfare is calculated risk," the Duke said, "but when
it comes to risking your own family, the element of calculation gets submerged
in . . . other things."
He knew he wasn't holding in his anger as well as he should, and he turned,
strode down the length of the long table and back.
The Duke and Paul were alone in the conference room at the landing field. It
was an empty-sounding room, furnished only with the long table, old-fashioned
three-legged chairs around it, and a map board and projector at one end. Paul
sat at the table near the map board. He had told his father the experience with
the hunter-seeker and given the reports that a traitor threatened him.
The Duke stopped across from Paul, pounded the table: "Hawat told me that
house was secure!"
Paul spoke hesitantly: "I was angry, too--at first. And I blamed Hawat. But
the threat came from outside the house. It was simple, clever, and direct. And
it would've succeeded were it not for the training given me by you and many
others--including Hawat."
"Are you defending him?" the Duke demanded.
"Yes."
"He's getting old. That's it. He should be--"
"He's wise with much experience," Paul said. "How many of Hawat's mistakes
can you recall?"
"I should be the one defending him," the Duke said. "Not you."
Paul smiled.
Leto sat down at the head of the table, put a hand over his son's. "You've .
. . matured lately, Son." He lifted his hand. "It gladdens me." He matched his
son's smile. "Hawat will punish himself. He'll direct more anger against himself
over this than both of us together could pour on him."
Paul glanced toward the darkened windows beyond the map board, looked at the
night's blackness. Room lights reflected from a balcony railing out there. He
saw movement and recognized the shape of a guard in Atreides uniform. Paul
looked back at the white wall behind his father, then down to the shiny surface
of the table, seeing his own hands clenched into fists there.

The door opposite the Duke banged open. Thufir Hawat strode through it
looking older and more leathery than ever. He paced down the length of the
table, stopped at attention facing Leto.
"My Lord," he said, speaking to a point over Leto's head, "I have just
learned how I failed you. It becomes necessary that I tender my resig--"
"Oh, sit down and stop acting the fool," the Duke said. He waved to the
chair across from Paul. "If you made a mistake, it was in overestimating the
Harkonnens. Their simple minds came up with a simple trick. We didn't count on
simple tricks. And my son has been at great pains to point out to me that he
came through this largely because of your training. You didn't fail there!" He
tapped the back of the empty chair. "Sit down, I say!"
Hawat sank into the chair. "But--"
"I'll hear no more of it," the Duke said. "The incident is past. We have
more pressing business. Where are the others?"
"I asked them to wait outside while I--"
"Call them in."
Hawat looked into Leto's eyes. "Sire, I--"
"I know who my true friends are, Thufir," the Duke said. "Call in the men."
Hawat swallowed. "At once, my Lord." He swiveled in the chair, called to the
open door: "Gurney, bring them in."
Halleck led the file of men into the room, the staff officers looking grimly
serious followed by the younger aides and specialists, an air of eagerness among
them. Brief scuffing sounds echoed around the room as the men took seats. A
faint smell of rachag stimulant wafted down the table.
"There's coffee for those who want it," the Duke said.
He looked over his men, thinking: They're a good crew. A man could do far
worse for this kind of war. He waited while coffee was brought in from the
adjoining room and served, noting the tiredness in some of the faces.
Presently, he put on his mask of quiet efficiency, stood up and commanded
their attention with a knuckle rap against the table.
"Well, gentlemen," he said, "our civilization appears to've fallen so deeply
into the habit of invasion that we cannot even obey a simple order of the
Imperium without the old ways cropping up."
Dry chuckles sounded around the table, and Paul realized that his father had
said the precisely correct thing in precisely the correct tone to lift the mood
here. Even the hint of fatigue in his voice was right.
"I think first we'd better learn if Thufir has anything to add to his report
on the Fremen," the Duke said. "Thufir?"
Hawat glanced up. "I've some economic matters to go into after my general
report, Sire, but I can say now that the Fremen appear more and more to be the
allies we need. They're waiting now to see if they can trust us, but they appear
to be dealing openly. They've sent us a gift--stillsuits of their own
manufacture . . . maps of certain desert areas surrounding strongpoints the
Harkonnens left behind, . . ." He glanced down at the table. "Their intelligence
reports have proved completely reliable and have helped us considerably in our
dealings with the Judge of the Change. They've also sent some incidental things-jewelry for the Lady Jessica, spice liquor, candy, medicinals. My men are
processing the lot right now. There appears to be no trickery."
"You like these people, Thufir?" asked a man down the table.
Hawat turned to face his questioner. "Duncan Idaho says they're to be
admired."
Paul glanced at his father, back to Hawat, ventured a question: "Have you
any new information on how many Fremen there are?"
Hawat looked at Paul. "From food processing and other evidence, Idaho
estimates the cave complex he visited consisted of some ten thousand people, all
told. Their leader said he ruled a sietch of two thousand hearths. We've reason
to believe there are a great many such sietch communities. All seem to give
their allegiance to someone called Liet."
"That's something new," Leto said.
"It could be an error on my part, Sire. There are things to suggest this
Liet may be a local deity."
Another man down the table cleared his throat, asked: "Is it certain they
deal with the smugglers?"
"A smuggler caravan left this sietch while Idaho was there, carrying a heavy
load of spice. They used pack beasts and indicated they faced an eighteen-day
journey."
"It appears," the Duke said, "that the smugglers have redoubled their
operations during this period of unrest. This deserves some careful thought. We
shouldn't worry too much about unlicensed frigates working off our planet--it's
always done. But to have them completely outside our observation--that's not
good."
"You have a plan. Sire," Hawat asked.
The Duke looked at Halleck. "Gurney, I want you to head a delegation, an
embassy if you will, to contact these romantic businessmen. Tell them I'll
ignore their operations as long as they give me a ducal tithe. Hawat here
estimates that graft and extra fighting men heretofore required in their
operations have been costing them four times that amount."
"What if the Emperor gets wind of this?" Halleck asked. "He's very jealous
of his CHOAM profits, m'Lord."
Leto smiled. "We'll bank the entire tithe openly in the name of Shaddam IV
and deduct it legally from our levy support costs. Let the Harkonnens fight
that! And we'll be ruining a few more of the locals who grew fat under the
Harkonnen system. No more graft!"
A grin twisted Halleck's face. "Ahh, m'Lord, a beautiful low blow. Would
that I could see the Baron's face when he learns of this."
The Duke turned to Hawat. "Thufir, did you get those account books you said
you could buy?"
"Yes, my Lord. They're being examined in detail even now. I've skimmed them,
though, and can give a first approximation."
"Give it, then."
"The Harkonnens took ten billion Solaris out of here every three hundred and
thirty Standard days."
A muted gasp ran around the table. Even the younger aides, who had been
betraying some boredom, sat up straighter and exchanged wide-eyed looks.
Halleck murmured: " 'For they shall suck of the abundance of the seas and of
the treasure hid in the sand.' "
"You see, gentlemen," Leto said. "Is there anyone here so naive he believes
the Harkonnens have quietly packed up and walked away from all this merely
because the Emperor ordered it?"
There was a general shaking of heads, murmurous agreement.
"We will have to take it at the point of the sword," Leto said. He turned to
Hawat. "This'd be a good point to report on equipment. How many sandcrawlers,
harvesters, spice factories, and supporting equipment have they left us?"
"A full complement, as it says in the Imperial inventory audited by the
Judge of the Change, my Lord," Hawat said. He gestured for an aide to pass him a
folder, opened the folder on the table in front of him. "They neglect to mention
that less than half the crawlers are operable, that only about a third have
carryalls to fly them to spice sands--that everything the Harkonnens left us is
ready to break down and fall apart. We'll be lucky to get half the equipment
into operation and luckier yet if a fourth of it's still working six months from
now."
"Pretty much as we expected," Leto said. "What's the firm estimate on basic
equipment?"
Hawat glanced at his folder. "About nine hundred and thirty harvesterfactories that can be sent out in a few days. About sixty-two hundred and fifty
ornithopters for survey, scouting, and weather observation . . . carryalls, a
little under a thousand."
Halleck said: "Wouldn't it be cheaper to reopen negotiations with the Guild
for permission to orbit a frigate as a weather satellite?"
The Duke looked at Hawat. "Nothing new there, eh, Thufir?"
"We must pursue other avenues for now," Hawat said. "The Guild agent wasn't
really negotiating with us. He was merely making it plain--one Mentat to
another--that the price was out of our reach and would remain so no matter how
long a reach we develop. Our task is to find out why before we approach him
again."
One of Halleck's aides down the table swiveled in his chair, snapped:
"There's no justice in this!"
"Justice?" The Duke looked at the man. "Who asks for justice? We make our
own justice. We make it here on Arrakis--win or die, Do you regret casting your
lot with us, sir?"
The man stared at the Duke, then: "No, Sire. You couldn't turn and I could
do nought but follow you. Forgive the outburst, but . . ." He shrugged. " . . .
we must all feel bitter at times."
"Bitterness I understand," the Duke said. "But let us not rail about justice
as long as we have arms and the freedom to use them. Do any of the rest of you
harbor bitterness? If so, let it out. This is friendly council where any man may
speak his mind."
Halleck stirred, said: "I think what rankles, Sire, is that we've had no
volunteers from the other Great Houses. They address you as 'Leto the Just' and
promise eternal friendship, but only as long as it doesn't cost them anything."
"They don't know yet who's going to win this exchange," the Duke said. "Most
of the Houses have grown fat by taking few risks. One cannot truly blame them
for this; one can only despise them." He looked at Hawat. "We were discussing
equipment. Would you care to project a few examples to familiarize the men with
this machinery?"
Hawat nodded, gestured to an aide at the projector.
A solido tri-D projection appeared on the table surface about a third of the
way down from the Duke. Some of the men farther along the table stood up to get
a better look at it.
Paul leaned forward, staring at the machine.
Scaled against the tiny projected human figures around it, the thing was
about one hundred and twenty meters long and about forty meters wide. It was
basically a long, bug-like body moving on independent sets of wide tracks.
"This is a harvester factory," Hawat said. "We chose one in good repair for
this projection. There's one dragline outfit that came in with the first team of
Imperial ecologists, though, and it's still running . . . although I don't know
how . . . or why."
"If that's the one they call 'Old Maria,' it belongs in a museum," an aide
said. "I think the Harkonnens kept it as a punishment job, a threat hanging over
their workers' heads. Be good or you'll be assigned to 'Old Maria.' "
Chuckles sounded around the table.
Paul held himself apart from the humor, his attention focused on the
projection and the question that filled his mind. He pointed to the image on the
table, said: "Thufir, are there sandworms big enough to swallow that whole?"
Quick silence settled on the table. The Duke cursed under his breath, then
thought: No--they have to face the realities here.
"There're worms in the deep desert could take this entire factory in one
gulp," Hawat said. "Up here closer to the Shield Wall where most of the
spicing's done there are plenty of worms that could cripple this factory and
devour it at their leisure."
"Why don't we shield them?" Paul asked.
"According to Idaho's report," Hawat said, "shields are dangerous in the
desert. A body-size shield will call every worm for hundreds of meters around.
It appears to drive them into a killing frenzy. We've the Fremen word on this
and no reason to doubt it. Idaho saw no evidence of shield equipment at the
sietch."
"None at all?" Paul asked.
"It'd be pretty hard to conceal that kind of thing among several thousand
people," Hawat said. "Idaho had free access to every part of the sietch. He saw
no shields or any indication of their use."
"It's a puzzle," the Duke said.
"The Harkonnens certainly used plenty of shields here," Hawat said. "They
had repair depots in every garrison village, and their accounts show a heavy
expenditure for shield replacements and parts."
"Could the Fremen have a way of nullifying shields?" Paul asked.
"It doesn't seem likely," Hawat said. "It's theoretically possible, of
course--a shire-sized static counter charge is supposed to do the trick, but no
one's ever been able to put it to the test."
"We'd have heard about it before now," Halleck said. "The smugglers have
close contact with the Fremen and would've acquired such a device if it were
available. And they'd have had no inhibitions against marketing it off planet."
"I don't like an unanswered question of this importance," Leto said.
"Thufir, I want you to give top priority to solution of this problem."
"We're already working on it, my Lord." He cleared his throat. "Ah-h, Idaho
did say one thing: he said you couldn't mistake the Fremen attitude toward
shields. He said they were mostly amused by them."
The Duke frowned, then: "The subject under discussion is spicing equipment."
Hawat gestured to his aide at the projector.
The solido-image of the harvester-factory was replaced by a projection of a
winged device that dwarfed the images of human figures around it. "This is a
carryall," Hawat said. "It's essentially a large 'thopter, whose sole function
is to deliver a factory to spice-rich sands, then to rescue the factory when a
sandworm appears. They always appear. Harvesting the spice is a process of
getting in and getting out with as much as possible."
"Admirably suited to Harkonnen morality," the Duke said.
Laughter was abrupt and too loud.
An ornithopter replaced the carryall in the projection focus.
"These 'thopters are fairly conventional," Hawat said. "Major modifications
give them extended range. Extra care has been used in sealing essential areas
against sand and dust. Only about one in thirty is shielded--possibly discarding
the shield generator's weight for greater range."
"I don't like this de-emphasis on shields," the Duke muttered. And he
thought: Is this the Harkonnen secret? Does it mean we won't even be able to
escape on shielded frigates if all goes against us? He shook his head sharply to
drive out such thoughts, said: "Let's get to the working estimate. What'll our
profit figure be?"
Hawat turned two pages in his notebook. "After assessing the repairs and
operable equipment, we've worked out a first estimate on operating costs. It's
based naturally on a depreciated figure for a clear safety margin." He closed
his eyes in Mentat semitrance, said: "Under the Harkonnens, maintenance and
salaries were held to fourteen per cent. We'll be lucky to make it at thirty per
cent at first. With reinvestment and growth factors accounted for, including the
CHOAM percentage and military costs, our profit margin will be reduced to a very
narrow six or seven per cent until we can replace worn-out equipment. We then
should be able to boost it up to twelve or fifteen per cent where it belongs."
He opened his eyes. "Unless my Lord wishes to adopt Harkonnen methods."
"We're working for a solid and permanent planetary base," the Duke said. "We
have to keep a large percentage of the people happy--especially the Fremen."
"Most especially the Fremen," Hawat agreed.
"Our supremacy on Caladan," the Duke said, "depended on sea and air power.
Here, we must develop something I choose to call desert power. This may include
air power, but it's possible it may not. I call your attention to the lack of
'thopter shields." He shook his head. "The Harkonnens relied on turnover from
off planet for some of their key personnel. We don't dare. Each new lot would
have its quota of provocateurs."
"Then we'll have to be content with far less profit and a reduced harvest,"
Hawat said. "Our output the first two seasons should be down a third from the
Harkonnen average."
"There it is," the Duke said, "exactly as we expected. We'll have to move
fast with the Fremen. I'd like five full battalions of Fremen troops before the
first CHOAM audit."
"That's not much time, Sire," Hawat said.
"We don't have much time, as you well know. They'll be here with Sardaukar
disguised as Harkonnens at the first opportunity. How many do you think they'll
ship in, Thufir?"
"Four or five battalions all told, Sire. No more. Guild troop-transport
costs being what they are."
"Then five battalions of Fremen plus our own forces ought to do it. Let us
have a few captive Sardaukar to parade in front of the Landsraad Council and
matters will be much different--profits or no profits."
"We'll do our best, Sire."
Paul looked at his father, back to Hawat, suddenly conscious of the Mentat's
great age, aware that the old man had served three generations of Atreides.
Aged. It showed in the rheumy shine of the brown eyes, in the cheeks cracked and
burned by exotic weathers, in the rounded curve of the shoulders and the thin
set of his lips with the cranberry-colored stain of sapho juice.
So much depends on one aged man, Paul thought.
"We're presently in a war of assassins," the Duke said, "but it has not
achieved full scale. Thufir, what's the condition of the Harkonnen machine
here?"
"We've eliminated two hundred and fifty-nine of their key people, my Lord.
No more than three Harkonnen cells remain--perhaps a hundred people in all."
"These Harkonnen creatures you eliminated," the Duke said, "were they
propertied?"
"Most were well situated, my Lord--in the entrepreneur class."
"I want you to forge certificates of allegiance over the signatures of each
of them," the Duke said. "File copies with the Judge of the Change. We'll take
the legal position that they stayed under false allegiance. Confiscate their
property, take everything, turn out their families, strip them. And make sure
the Crown gets its ten per cent. It must be entirely legal."
Thufir smiled, revealing red-stained teeth beneath the carmine lips. "A move
worthy of your grandsire, my Lord. It shames me I didn't think of it first."
Halleck frowned across the table, surprised a deep scowl on Paul's face. The
others were smiling and nodding.
It's wrong, Paul thought. This'll only make the others fight all the harder.
They've nothing to gain by surrendering.
He knew the actual no-holds-barred convention that ruled in kanly, but this
was the sort of move that could destroy them even as it gave them victory.
" 'I have been a stranger in a strange land,' " Halleck quoted.
Paul stared at him, recognizing the quotation from the O.C. Bible,
wondering: Does Gurney, too, wish an end to devious plots?
The Duke glanced at the darkness out the windows, looked back at Halleck.
"Gurney, how many of those sandworkers did you persuade to stay with us?"
"Two hundred eighty-six in all, Sire. I think we should take them and
consider ourselves lucky. They're all in useful categories."
"No more?" The Duke pursed his lips, then: "Well, pass the word along to--"
A disturbance at the door interrupted him. Duncan Idaho came through the
guard there, hurried down the length of the table and bent over the Duke's ear.
Leto waved him back, said: "Speak out, Duncan. You can see this is strategy
staff."
Paul studied Idaho, marking the feline movements, the swiftness of reflex
that made him such a difficult weapons teacher to emulate. Idaho's dark round
face turned toward Paul, the cave-sitter eyes giving no hint of recognition, but
Paul recognized the mask of serenity over excitement.
Idaho looked down the length of the table, said: "We've taken a force of
Harkonnen mercenaries disguised as Fremen. The Fremen themselves sent us a
courier to warn of the false band. In the attack, however, we found the
Harkonnens had waylaid the Fremen courier--badly wounded him. We were bringing
him here for treatment by our medics when he died. I'd seen how badly off the
man was and stopped to do what I could. I surprised him in the attempt to throw
something away." Idaho glanced down at Leto. "A knife, m'Lord, a knife the like
of which you've never seen."
"Crysknife?" someone asked.
"No doubt of it," Idaho said. "Milky white and glowing with a light of its
own like." He reached into his tunic, brought out a sheath with a black-ridged
handle protruding from it.
"Keep that blade in its sheath!"
The voice came from the open door at the end of the room, a vibrant and
penetrating voice that brought them all up, staring.
A tall, robed figure stood in the door, barred by the crossed swords of the
guard. A light tan robe completely enveloped the man except for a gap in the
hood and black veil that exposed eyes of total blue--no white in them at all.
"Let him enter," Idaho whispered.
"Pass that man," the Duke said.
The guards hesitated, then lowered their swords.
The man swept into the room, stood across from the Duke.
"This is Stilgar, chief of the sietch I visited, leader of those who warned
us of the false band," Idaho said.
"Welcome, sir," Leto said. "And why shouldn't we unsheath this blade?"
Stilgar glanced at Idaho, said: "You observed the customs of cleanliness and
honor among us. I would permit you to see the blade of the man you befriended."
His gaze swept the others in the room. "But I do not know these others. Would
you have them defile an honorable weapon?"
"I am the Duke Leto," the Duke said. "Would you permit me to see this
blade?"
"I'll permit you to earn the right to unsheath it," Stilgar said, and, as a
mutter of protest sounded around the table, he raised a thin, darkly veined
hand. "I remind you this is the blade of one who befriended you."
In the waiting silence, Paul studied the man, sensing the aura of power that
radiated from him. He was a leader--a Fremen leader.
A man near the center of the table across from Paul muttered: "Who's he to
tell us what rights we have on Arrakis?"
"It is said that the Duke Leto Atreides rules with the consent of the
governed," the Fremen said. "Thus I must tell you the way it is with us: a
certain responsibility falls on those who have seen a crysknife." He passed a
dark glance across Idaho. "They are ours. They may never leave Arrakis without
our consent."
Halleck and several of the others started to rise, angry expressions on
their faces. Halleck said: "The Duke Leto determines whether--"
"One moment, please," Leto said, and the very mildness of his voice held
them. This must not get out of hand, he thought. He addressed himself to the
Fremen: "Sir, I honor and respect the personal dignity of any man who respects
my dignity. I am indeed indebted to you. And I always pay my debts. If it is
your custom that this knife remain sheathed here, then it is so ordered--by me.
And if there is any other way we may honor the man who died in our service, you
have but to name it."
The Fremen stared at the Duke, then slowly pulled aside his veil, revealing
a thin nose and full-lipped mouth in a glistening black beard. Deliberately he
bent over the end of the table, spat on its polished surface.
As the men around the table started to surge to their feet, Idaho's voice
boomed across the room: "Hold!"
Into the sudden charged stillness, Idaho said: "We thank you, Stilgar, for
the gift of your body's moisture. We accept it in the spirit with which it is
given." And Idaho spat on the table in front of the Duke.
Aside to the Duke, he said; "Remember how precious water is here, Sire. That
was a token of respect."
Leto sank back into his own chair, caught Paul's eye, a rueful grin on his
son's face, sensed the slow relaxation of tension around the table as
understanding came to his men.
The Fremen looked at Idaho, said: "You measured well in my sietch, Duncan
Idaho. Is there a bond on your allegiance to your Duke?"
"He's asking me to enlist with him. Sire," Idaho said.
"Would he accept a dual allegiance?" Leto asked.
"You wish me to go with him, Sire?"
"I wish you to make your own decision in the matter," Leto said, and he
could not keep the urgency out of his voice.
Idaho studied the Fremen. "Would you have me under these conditions,
Stilgar? There'd be times when I'd have to return to serve my Duke."
"You fight well and you did your best for our friend," Stilgar said. He
looked at Leto. "Let it be thus: the man Idaho keeps the crysknife he holds as a
mark of his allegiance to us. He must be cleansed, of course, and the rites
observed, but this can be done. He will be Fremen and soldier of the Atreides.
There is precedent for this: Liet serves two masters."
"Duncan?" Leto asked.
"I understand, Sire," Idaho said.
"It is agreed, then," Leto said.
"Your water is ours, Duncan Idaho." Stilgar said. "The body of our friend
remains with your Duke. His water is Atreides water. It is a bond between us."
Leto sighed, glanced at Hawat, catching the old Mentat's eye. Hawat nodded,
his expression pleased.
"I will await below," Stilgar said, "while Idaho makes farewell with his
friends. Turok was the name of our dead friend. Remember that when it comes time
to release his spirit. You are friends of Turok."
Stilgar started to turn away.
"Will you not stay a while?" Leto asked.
The Fremen turned back, whipping his veil into place with a casual gesture,
adjusting something beneath it. Paul glimpsed what looked like a thin tube
before the veil settled into place.
"Is there reason to stay?" the Fremen asked.
"We would honor you," the Duke said.
"Honor requires that I be elsewhere soon," the Fremen said. He shot another
glance at Idaho, whirled, and strode out past the door guards.
"If the other Fremen match him, we'll serve each other well," Leto said.
Idaho spoke in a dry voice: "He's a fair sample, Sire."
"You understand what you're to do, Duncan?"
"I'm your ambassador to the Fremen, Sire."
"Much depends on you, Duncan. We're going to need at least five battalions
of those people before the Sardaukar descend on us."
"This is going to take some doing, Sire. The Fremen are a pretty independent
bunch." Idaho hesitated, then: "And, Sire, there's one other thing. One of the
mercenaries we knocked over was trying to get this blade from our dead Fremen
friend. The mercenary says there's a Harkonnen reward of a million Solaris for
anyone who'll bring in a single crysknife."
Leto's chin came up in a movement of obvious surprise. "Why do they want one
of those blades so badly?"
"The knife is ground from a sandworm's tooth; it's the mark of the Fremen,
Sire. With it, a blue-eyed man could penetrate any sietch in the land. They'd
question me unless I were known. I don't look Fremen. But . . . "
"Piter de Vries," the Duke said.
"A man of devilish cunning, my Lord," Hawat said.
Idaho slipped the sheathed knife beneath his tunic.
"Guard that knife," the Duke said.
"I understand, m'Lord." He patted the transceiver on his belt kit. "I'll
report soon as possible. Thufir has my call code. Use battle language." He
saluted, spun about, and hurried after the Fremen.
They heard his footsteps drumming down the corridor.
A look of understanding passed between Leto and Hawat. They smiled.
"We've much to do, Sire," Halleck said.
"And I keep you from your work," Leto said.
"I have the report on the advance bases," Hawat said. "Shall I give it
another time, Sire?"
"Will it take long?"
"Not for a briefing. It's said among the Fremen that there were more than
two hundred of these advance bases built here on Arrakis during the Desert
Botanical Testing Station period. All supposedly have been abandoned, but there
are reports they were sealed off before being abandoned."
"Equipment in them?" the Duke asked.
"According to the reports I have from Duncan."
"Where are they located?" Halleck asked.
"The answer to that question," Hawat said, "is invariably: 'Liet knows.' "
"God knows," Leto muttered.
"Perhaps not. Sire," Hawat said. "You heard this Stilgar use the name. Could
he have been referring to a real person?"
"Serving two masters," Halleck said. "It sounds like a religious quotation."
"And you should know," the Duke said.
Halleck smiled.
"This Judge of the Change," Leto said, "the Imperial ecologist--Kynes . . .
Wouldn't he know where those bases are?"
"Sire," Hawat cautioned, "this Kynes is an Imperial servant."
"And he's a long way from the Emperor," Leto said. "I want those bases.
They'd be loaded with materials we could salvage and use for repair of our
working equipment."
"Sire!" Hawat said. "Those bases are still legally His Majesty's fief."
"The weather here's savage enough to destroy anything," the Duke said. "We
can always blame the weather. Get this Kynes and at least find out if the bases
exist."
" 'Twere dangerous to commandeer them," Hawat said. "Duncan was clear on one
thing: those bases or the idea of them hold some deep significance for the
Fremen. We might alienate the Fremen if we took those bases."
Paul looked at the faces of the men around them, saw the intensity of the
way they followed every word. They appeared deeply disturbed by his father's
attitude.
"Listen to him, Father," Paul said in a low voice. "He speaks truth."
"Sire," Hawat said, "those bases could give us material to repair every
piece of equipment left us, yet be beyond reach for strategic reasons. It'd be
rash to move without greater knowledge. This Kynes has arbiter authority from
the Imperium. We mustn't forget that. And the Fremen defer to him."
"Do it gently, then," the Duke said. "I wish to know only if those bases
exist."
"As you will, Sire." Hawat sat back, lowered his eyes.
"All right, then," the Duke said. "We know what we have ahead of us--work.
We've been trained for it. We've some experience in it. We know what the rewards
are and the alternatives are clear enough. You all have your assignments." He
looked at Halleck. "Gurney, take care of that smuggler situation first."
" 'I shall go unto the rebellious that dwell in the dry land,' " Halleck
intoned.
"Someday I'll catch that man without a quotation and he'll look undressed,"
the Duke said.
Chuckles echoed around the table, but Paul heard the effort in them.
The Duke turned to Hawat. "Set up another command post for intelligence and
communications on this floor, Thufir. When you have them ready, I'll want to see
you."
Hawat arose, glanced around the room as though seeking support. He turned
away, led the procession out of the room. The others moved hurriedly, scraping
their chairs on the floor, balling up in little knots of confusion.
It ended up in confusion, Paul thought, staring at the backs of the last men
to leave. Always before, Staff had ended on an incisive air. This meeting had
just seemed to trickle out, worn down by its own inadequacies, and with an
argument to top it off.
For the first time, Paul allowed himself to think about the real possibility
of defeat--not thinking about it out of fear or because of warnings such as that
of the old Reverend Mother, but facing up to it because of his own assessment of
the situation.
My father is desperate, he thought. Things aren't going well for us at all.
And Hawat--Paul recalled how the old Mentat had acted during the conference-subtle hesitations, signs of unrest.
Hawat was deeply troubled by something.
"Best you remain here the rest of the night, Son," the Duke said. "It'll be
dawn soon, anyway. I'll inform your mother." He got to his feet, slowly,
stiffly. "Why don't you pull a few of these chairs together and stretch out on
them for some rest."
"I'm not very tired, sir."
"As you will."
The Duke folded his hands behind him, began pacing up and down the length of
the table.
Like a caged animal, Paul thought.
"Are you going to discuss the traitor possibility with Hawat?" Paul asked.
The Duke stopped across from his son, spoke to the dark windows. "We've
discussed the possibility many times."
"The old woman seemed so sure of herself," Paul said. "And the message
Mother--"
"Precautions have been taken," the Duke said. He looked around the room, and
Paul marked the hunted wildness in his father's eyes. "Remain here. There are
some things about the command posts I want to discuss with Thufir." He turned,
strode out of the room, nodding shortly to the door guards.
Paul stared at the place where his father had stood. The space had been
empty even before the Duke left the room. And he recalled the old woman's
warning: " . . . for the father, nothing."
= = = = = =
On that first day when Muad'Dib rode through the streets of Arrakeen with his
family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy
and they ventured to shout: "Mahdi!" But their shout was more a question than a
statement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the Lisan
al-Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World. Their attention was focused, too, on
the mother, because they had heard she was a Bene Gesserit and it was obvious to
them that she was like the other Lisan al-Gaib.
-from "Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
The Duke found Thufir Hawat alone in the corner room to which a guard
directed him. There was the sound of men setting up communications equipment in
an adjoining room, but this place was fairly quiet. The Duke glanced around as
Hawat arose from a paper-cluttered table. It was a green-walled enclosure with,
in addition to the table, three suspensor chairs from which the Harkonnen "H"
had been hastily removed, leaving an imperfect color patch.
"The chairs are liberated but quite safe," Hawat said. "Where is Paul,
Sire?"
"I left him in the conference room. I'm hoping he'll get some rest without
me there to distract him."
Hawat nodded, crossed to the door to the adjoining room, closed it, shutting
off the noise of static and electronic sparking.
"Thufir," Leto said, "the Imperial and Harkonnen stockpiles of spice attract
my attention."
"M'Lord?"
The Duke pursed his lips. "Storehouses are susceptible to destruction." He
raised a hand as Hawat started to speak. "Ignore the Emperor's hoard. He'd
secretly enjoy it if the Harkonnens were embarrassed. And can the Baron object
if something is destroyed which he cannot openly admit that he has?"
Hawat shook his head. "We've few men to spare. Sire."
"Use some of Idaho's men. And perhaps some of the Fremen would enjoy a trip
off planet. A raid on Giedi Prime--there are tactical advantages to such a
diversion, Thufir."
"As you say, my Lord." Hawat turned away, and the Duke saw evidence of
nervousness in the old man, thought: Perhaps he suspects I distrust him. He must
know I've private reports of traitors. Well--best quiet his fears immediately.
"Thufir," he said, "since you're one of the few I can trust completely,
there's another matter bears discussion. We both know how constant a watch we
must keep to prevent traitors from infiltrating our forces . . . but I have two
new reports."
Hawat turned, stared at him.
And Leto repeated the stories Paul had brought.
Instead of bringing on the intense Mentat concentration, the reports only
increased Hawat's agitation.
Leto studied the old man and, presently, said: "You've been holding
something back, old friend. I should've suspected when you were so nervous
during Staff. What is it that was too hot to dump in front of the full
conference?"
Hawat's sapho-stained lips were pulled into a prim, straight line with tiny
wrinkles radiating into them. They maintained their wrinkled stiffness as he
said: "My Lord, I don't quite know how to broach this."
"We've suffered many a scar for each other, Thufir," the Duke said. "You
know you can broach any subject with me."
Hawat continued to stare at him, thinking: This is how I like him best. This
is the man of honor who deserves every bit of my loyalty and service. Why must I
hurt him?
"Well?" Leto demanded.

Hawat shrugged. "It's a scrap of a note. We took it from a Harkonnen
courier. The note was intended for an agent named Pardee. We've good reason to
believe Pardee was top man in the Harkonnen underground here. The note--it's a
thing that could have great consequence or no consequence. It's susceptible to
various interpretations."
"What's the delicate content of this note?"
"Scrap of a note, my Lord. Incomplete. It was on minimic film with the usual
destruction capsule attached. We stopped the acid action just short of full
erasure, leaving only a fragment. The fragment, however, is extremely
suggestive."
"Yes?"
Hawat rubbed at his lips. "It says: ' . . . eto will never suspect, and when
the blow falls on him from a beloved hand, its source alone should be enough to
destroy him.' The note was under the Baron's own seal and I've authenticated the
seal."
"Your suspicion is obvious," the Duke said and his voice was suddenly cold.
"I'd sooner cut off my arms than hurt you," Hawat said. "My Lord, what if .
. ."
"The Lady Jessica," Leto said, and he felt anger consuming him. "Couldn't
you wring the facts out of this Pardee?"
"Unfortunately, Pardee no longer was among the living when we intercepted
the courier. The courier, I'm certain, did not know what he carried."
"I see."
Leto shook his head, thinking: What a slimy piece of business. There can't
be anything in it. I know my woman.
"My Lord, if--"
"No!" the Duke barked. "There's a mistake here that--"
"We cannot ignore it, my Lord."
"She's been with me for sixteen years! There've been countless opportunities
for--You yourself investigated the school and the woman!"
Hawat spoke bitterly: "Things have been known to escape me."
"It's impossible, I tell you! The Harkonnens want to destroy the Atreides
line--meaning Paul, too. They've already tried once. Could a woman conspire
against her own son?"
"Perhaps she doesn't conspire against her son. And yesterday's attempt
could've been a clever sham."
"It couldn't have been a sham."
"Sire, she isn't supposed to know her parentage, but what if she does know?
What if she were an orphan, say, orphaned by an Atreides?"
"She'd have moved long before now. Poison in my drink . . . a stiletto at
night. Who has had better opportunity?"
"The Harkonnens mean to destroy you, my Lord. Their intent is not just to
kill. There's a range of fine distinctions in kanly. This could be a work of art
among vendettas."
The Duke's shoulders slumped. He closed his eyes, looking old and tired. It
cannot be, he thought. The woman has opened her heart to me.
"What better way to destroy me than to sow suspicion of the woman I love?"
he asked.
"An interpretation I've considered," Hawat said. "Still . . . "
The Duke opened his eyes, stared at Hawat, thinking: Let him be suspicious.
Suspicion is his trade, not mine. Perhaps if I appear to believe this, that will
make another man careless.
"What do you suggest?" the Duke whispered.
"For now, constant surveillance, my Lord. She should be watched at all
times. I will see it's done unobtrusively. Idaho would be the ideal choice for
the job. Perhaps in a week or so we can bring him back. There's a young man
we've been training in Idaho's troop who might be ideal to send to the Fremen as
a replacement. He's gifted in diplomacy."
"Don't jeopardize our foothold with the Fremen."
"Of course not, Sire."
"And what about Paul?"
"Perhaps we could alert Dr. Yueh."
Leto turned his back on Hawat. "I leave it in your hands."
"I shall use discretion, my Lord."
At least I can count on that, Leto thought. And he said: "I will take a
walk. If you need me, I'll be within the perimeter. The guard can--"
"My Lord, before you go, I've a filmclip you should read. It's a firstapproximation analysis on the Fremen religion. You'll recall you asked me to
report on it."
The Duke paused, spoke without turning. "Will it not wait?"
"Of course, my Lord. You asked what they were shouting, though. It was
'Mahdi!' They directed the term at the young master. When they--"
"At Paul?"
"Yes, my Lord. They've a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come to
them, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them to true freedom. It follows the
familiar messiah pattern."
"They think Paul is this . . . this . . . "
"They only hope, my Lord." Hawat extended a filmclip capsule.
The Duke accepted it, thrust it into a pocket. "I'll look at it later."
"Certainly, my Lord."
"Right now, I need time to . . . think."
"Yes, my Lord."
The Duke took a deep sighing breath, strode out the door. He turned to his
right down the hall, began walking, hands behind his back, paying little
attention to where he was. There were corridors and stairs and balconies and
halls . . . people who saluted and stood aside for him.
In time he came back to the conference room, found it dark and Paul asleep
on the table with a guard's robe thrown over him and a ditty pack for a pillow.
The Duke walked softly down the length of the room and onto the balcony
overlooking the landing field. A guard at the corner of the balcony, recognizing
the Duke by the dim reflection of lights from the field, snapped to attention.
"At ease," the Duke murmured. He leaned against the cold metal of the
balcony rail.
A predawn hush had come over the desert basin. He looked up. Straight
overhead, the stars were a sequin shawl flung over blue-black. Low on the
southern horizon, the night's second moon peered through a thin dust haze--an
unbelieving moon that looked at him with a cynical light.
As the Duke watched, the moon dipped beneath the Shield Wall cliffs,
frosting them, and in the sudden intensity of darkness, he experienced a chill.
He shivered.
Anger shot through him.
The Harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last time, he
thought. They are dung heaps with village provost minds! Here I make my stand!
And he thought with a touch of sadness: I must rule with eye and claw--as the
hawk among lesser birds. Unconsciously, his hand brushed the hawk emblem on his
tunic.
To the east, the night grew a faggot of luminous gray, then seashell
opalescence that dimmed the stars. There came the long, bell-tolling movement of
dawn striking across a broken horizon.
It was a scene of such beauty it caught all his attention.
Some things beggar likeness, he thought.
He had never imagined anything here could be as beautiful as that shattered
red horizon and the purple and ochre cliffs. Beyond the landing field where the
night's faint dew had touched life into the hurried seeds of Arrakis, he saw
great puddles of red blooms and, running through them, an articulate tread of
violet . . . like giant footsteps.
"It's a beautiful morning. Sire," the guard said.
"Yes, it is."
The Duke nodded, thinking: Perhaps this planet could grow on one. Perhaps it
could become a good home for my son.
Then he saw the human figures moving into the flower fields, sweeping them
with strange scythe-like devices--dew gatherers. Water so precious, here that
even the dew must be collected.
And it could be a hideous place, the Duke thought.

"There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in
which you discover your father is a man--with human flesh."
-from "Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
The Duke said: "Paul, I'm doing a hateful thing, but I must." He stood
beside the portable poison snooper that had been brought into the conference
room for their breakfast. The thing's sensor arms hung limply over the table,
reminding Paul of some weird insect newly dead.
The Duke's attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and
its roiling of dust against the morning sky.
Paul had a viewer in front of him containing a short filmclip on Fremen
religious practices. The clip had been compiled by one of Hawat's experts and
Paul found himself disturbed by the references to himself.
"Mahdi!"
"Lisan al-Gaib!"
He could close his eyes and recall the shouts of the crowds. So that is what
they hope, he thought. And he remembered what the old Reverend Mother had said:
Kwisatz Haderach. The memories touched his feelings of terrible purpose, shading
this strange world with sensations of familiarity that he could not understand.
"A hateful thing," the Duke said.
"What do you mean, sir?"
Leto turned, looked down at his son. "Because the Harkonnens think to trick
me by making me distrust your mother. They don't know that I'd sooner distrust
myself."
"I don't understand, sir."
Again, Leto looked out the windows. The white sun was well up into its
morning quadrant. Milky light picked out a boiling of dust clouds that spilled
over into the blind canyons interfingering the Shield Wall.
Slowly, speaking in a slow voice to contain his anger, the Duke explained to
Paul about the mysterious note.
"You might just as well mistrust me," Paul said.
"They have to think they've succeeded," the Duke said. "They must think me
this much of a fool. It must look real. Even your mother may not know the sham."
"But, sir! Why?"
"Your mother's response must not be an act. Oh, she's capable of a supreme
act . . . but too much rides on this. I hope to smoke out a traitor. It must
seem that I've been completely cozened. She must be hurt this way that she does
not suffer greater hurt."
"Why do you tell me, Father? Maybe I'll give it away."
"They'll not watch you in this thing," the Duke said. "You'll keep the
secret. You must." He walked to the windows, spoke without turning. "This way,
if anything should happen to me, you can tell her the truth--that I never
doubted her, not for the smallest instant. I should want her to know this."
Paul recognized the death thoughts in his father's words, spoke quickly:
"Nothing's going to happen to you, sir. The--"
"Be silent, Son."
Paul stared at his father's back, seeing the fatigue in the angle of the
neck, in the line of the shoulders, in the slow movements.
"You're just tired, Father."
"I am tired," the Duke agreed. "I'm morally tired. The melancholy
degeneration of the Great Houses has afflicted me at last, perhaps. And we were
such strong people once."
Paul spoke in quick anger: "Our House hasn't degenerated!"
"Hasn't it?"
The Duke turned, faced his son, revealing dark circles beneath hard eyes, a
cynical twist of mouth. "I should wed your mother, make her my Duchess. Yet . .
. my unwedded state gives some Houses hope they may yet ally with me through
their marriageable daughters." He shrugged. "So, I . . . "
"Mother has explained this to me."
"Nothing wins more loyalty for a leader than an air of bravura," the Duke
said. "I, therefore, cultivate an air of bravura."
"You lead well," Paul protested. "You govern well. Men follow you willingly
and love you."
"My propaganda corps is one of the finest," the Duke said. Again, he turned
to stare out at the basin. "There's greater possibility for us here on Arrakis
than the Imperium could ever suspect. Yet sometimes I think it'd have been
better if we'd run for it, gone renegade. Sometimes I wish we could sink back
into anonymity among the people, become less exposed to . . . "
"Father!"
"Yes, I am tired," the Duke said. "Did you know we're using spice residue as
raw material and already have our own factory to manufacture filmbase?"
"Sir?"
"We mustn't run short of filmbase," the Duke said. "Else, how could we flood
village and city with our information? The people must learn how well I govern
them. How would they know if we didn't tell them?"
"You should get some rest," Paul said.
Again, the Duke faced his son. "Arrakis has another advantage I almost
forgot to mention. Spice is in everything here. You breathe it and eat it in
almost everything. And I find that this imparts a certain natural immunity to
some of the most common poisons of the Assassins' Handbook. And the need to
watch every drop of water puts all food production--yeast culture, hydroponics,
chemavit, everything--under the strictest surveillance. We cannot kill off large
segments of our population with poison--and we cannot be attacked this way,
either. Arrakis makes us moral and ethical."
Paul started to speak, but the Duke cut him off, saying: "I have to have
someone I can say these things to, Son." He sighed, glanced back at the dry
landscape where even the flowers were gone now--trampled by the dew gatherers,
wilted under the early sun.
"On Caladan, we ruled with sea and air power," the Duke said. "Here, we must
scrabble for desert power. This is your inheritance, Paul. What is to become of
you if anything happens to me? You'll not be a renegade House, but a guerrilla
House--running, hunted."
Paul groped for words, could find nothing to say. He had never seen his
father this despondent.
"To hold Arrakis," the Duke said, "one is faced with decisions that may cost
one his self-respect." He pointed out the window to the Atreides green and black
banner hanging limply from a staff at the edge of the landing field. "That
honorable banner could come to mean many evil things."
Paul swallowed in a dry throat. His father's words carried futility, a sense
of fatalism that left the boy with an empty feeling in his chest.

The Duke took an antifatigue tablet from a pocket, gulped it dry. "Power and
fear," he said. "The tools of statecraft. I must order new emphasis on guerrilla
training for you. That filmclip there--they call you 'Mahdi'--'Lisan al-Gaib'-as a last resort, you might capitalize on that."
Paul stared at his father, watching the shoulders straighten as the tablet
did its work, but remembering the words of fear and doubt.
"What's keeping that ecologist?" the Duke muttered. "I told Thufir to have
him here early."

My father, the Padishah Emperor, took me by the hand one day and I sensed in the
ways my mother had taught me that he was disturbed. He led me down the Hall of
Portraits to the ego-likeness of the Duke Leto Atreides. I marked the strong
resemblance between them--my father and this man in the portrait--both with
thin, elegant faces and sharp features dominated by cold eyes. "Princessdaughter," my father said, "I would that you'd been older when it came time for
this man to choose a woman." My father was 71 at the time and looking no older
than the man in the portrait, and I was but 14, yet I remember deducing in that
instant that my father secretly wished the Duke had been his son, and disliked
the political necessities that made them enemies.
-"In My Father's House" by the Princess Irulan
His first encounter with the people he had been ordered to betray left Dr.
Kynes shaken. He prided himself on being a scientist to whom legends were merely
interesting clues, pointing toward cultural roots. Yet the boy fitted the
ancient prophecy so precisely. He had "the questing eyes," and the air of
"reserved candor."
Of course, the prophecy left certain latitude as to whether the Mother
Goddess would bring the Messiah with her or produce Him on the scene. Still,
there was this odd correspondence between prediction and persons.
They met in midmorning outside the Arrakeen landing field's administration
building. An unmarked ornithopter squatted nearby, humming softly on standby
like a somnolent insect. An Atreides guard stood beside it with bared sword and
the faint air-distortion of a shield around him.
Kynes sneered at the shield pattern, thinking: Arrakis has a surprise for
them there!
The planetologist raised a hand, signaled for his Fremen guard to fall back.
He strode on ahead toward the building's entrance--the dark hole in plasticcoated rock. So exposed, that monolithic building, he thought. So much less
suitable than a cave.
Movement within the entrance caught his attention. He stopped, taking the
moment to adjust his robe and the set of his stillsuit at the left shoulder.
The entrance doors swung wide. Atreides guards emerged swiftly, all of them
heavily armed--slow-pellet stunners, swords and shields. Behind them came a tall
man, hawk-faced, dark of skin and hair. He wore a jubba cloak with Atreides
crest at the breast, and wore it in a way that betrayed his unfamiliarity with
the garment. It clung to the legs of his stillsuit on one side. It lacked a
free-swinging, striding rhythm.
Beside the man walked a youth with the same dark hair, but rounder in the
face. The youth seemed small for the fifteen years Kynes knew him to have. But
the young body carried a sense of command, a poised assurance, as though he saw
and knew things all around him that were not visible to others. And he wore the
same style cloak as his father, yet with casual ease that made one think the boy
had always worn such clothing.
"The Mahdi will be aware of things others cannot see," went the prophecy.
Kynes shook his head, telling himself: They're just people.

With the two, garbed like them for the desert, came a man Kynes recognized-Gurney Halleck. Kynes took a deep breath to still his resentment against
Halleck, who had briefed him on how to behave with the Duke and ducal heir.
"You may call the Duke 'my Lord ' or 'Sire.' 'Noble Born' also is correct,
but usually reserved for more formal occasions. The son may be addressed as
'young Master' or 'my Lord.' The Duke is a man of much leniency, but brooks
little familiarity."
And Kynes thought as he watched the group approach: They'll learn soon
enough who's master on Arrakis. Order me questioned half the night by that
Mentat, will they? Expect me to guide them on an inspection of spice mining, do
they?
The import of Hawat's questions had not escaped Kynes. They wanted the
Imperial bases. And it was obvious they'd learned of the bases from Idaho.
I will have Stilgar send Idaho's head to this Duke, Kynes told himself.
The ducal party was only a few paces away now, their feet in desert boots
crunching the sand.
Kynes bowed. "My Lord, Duke."
As he had approached the solitary figure standing near the ornithopter, Leto
had studied him: tall, thin, dressed for the desert in loose robe, stillsuit,
and low boots. The man's hood was thrown back, its veil hanging to one side,
revealing long sandy hair, a sparse beard. The eyes were that fathomless bluewithin-blue under thick brows. Remains of dark stains smudged his eye sockets.
"You're the ecologist," the Duke said.
"We prefer the old title here, my Lord," Kynes said. "Planetologist."
"As you wish," the Duke said. He glanced down at Paul. "Son, this is the
Judge of the Change, the arbiter of dispute, the man set here to see that the
forms are obeyed in our assumption of power over this fief." He glanced at
Kynes. "And this is my son."
"My Lord," Kynes said.
"Are you a Fremen?" Paul asked.
Kynes smiled. "I am accepted in both sietch and village, young Master. But I
am in His Majesty's service, the Imperial Planetologist."
Paul nodded, impressed by the man's air of strength. Halleck had pointed
Kynes out to Paul from an upper window of the administration building: "The man
standing there with the Fremen escort--the one moving now toward the
ornithopter."
Paul had inspected Kynes briefly with binoculars, noting the prim, straight
mouth, the high forehead. Halleck had spoken in Paul's ear: "Odd sort of fellow.
Has a precise way of speaking--clipped off, no fuzzy edges--razor-apt."
And the Duke, behind them, had said: "Scientist type."
Now, only a few feet from the man, Paul sensed the power in Kynes, the
impact of personality, as though he were blood royal, born to command.
"I understand we have you to thank for our stillsuits and these cloaks," the
Duke said.
"I hope they fit well, my Lord," Kynes said. "They're of Fremen make and as
near as possible the dimensions given me by your man Halleck here."
"I was concerned that you said you couldn't take us into the desert unless
we wore these garments," the Duke said. "We can carry plenty of water. We don't
intend to be out long and we'll have air cover--the escort you see overhead
right now. It isn't likely we'd be forced down."
Kynes stared at him, seeing the water-fat flesh. He spoke coldly: "You never
talk of likelihoods on Arrakis. You speak only of possibilities."
Halleck stiffened. "The Duke is to be addressed as my Lord or Sire!"
Leto gave Halleck their private handsignal to desist, said: "Our ways are
new here, Gurney. We must make allowances."
"As you wish, Sire."
"We are indebted to you, Dr. Kynes," Leto said. "These suits and the
consideration for our welfare will be remembered."
On impulse, Paul called to mind a quotation from the O.C. Bible, said: "
'The gift is the blessing of the river.' "
The words rang out overloud in the still air. The Fremen escort Kynes had
left in the shade of the administration building leaped up from their squatting
repose, muttering in open agitation. One cried out: "Lisan al-Gaib!"
Kynes whirled, gave a curt, chopping signal with a hand, waved the guard
away. They fell back, grumbling among themselves, trailed away around the
building.
"Most interesting," Leto said.
Kynes passed a hard glare over the Duke and Paul, said: "Most of the desert
natives here are a superstitious lot. Pay no attention to them. They mean no
harm." But he thought of the words of the legend: "They will greet you with Holy
Words and your gifts will be a blessing."
Leto's assessment of Kynes--based partly on Hawat's brief verbal report
(guarded and full of suspicions)--suddenly crystallized: the man was Fremen.
Kynes had come with a Fremen escort, which could mean simply that the Fremen
were testing their new freedom to enter urban areas--but it had seemed an honor
guard. And by his manner, Kynes was a proud man, accustomed to freedom, his
tongue and his manner guarded only by his own suspicions. Paul's question had
been direct and pertinent.
Kynes had gone native.
"Shouldn't we be going, Sire?" Halleck asked.
The Duke nodded. "I'll fly my own 'thopter. Kynes can sit up front with me
to direct me. You and Paul take the rear seats."
"One moment, please," Kynes said. "With your permission, Sire, I must check
the security of your suits."
The Duke started to speak, but Kynes pressed on: "I have concern for my own
flesh as well as yours . . . my Lord. I'm well aware of whose throat would be
slit should harm befall you two while you're in my care."
The Duke frowned, thinking: How delicate this moment! If I refuse, it may
offend him. And this could be a man whose value to me is beyond measure. Yet . .
. to let him inside my shield, touching my person when I know so little about
him?
The thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels.
"We're in your hands," the Duke said. He stepped forward, opening his robe, saw
Halleck come up on the balls of his feet, poised and alert, but remaining where
he was. "And, if you'd be so kind," the Duke said, "I'd appreciate an
explanation of the suit from one who lives so intimately with it."
"Certainly," Kynes said. He felt up under the robe for the shoulder seals,
speaking as he examined the suit. "It's basically a micro-sandwich--a highefficiency filter and heat-exchange system." He adjusted the shoulder seals.
"The skin-contact layer's porous. Perspiration passes through it, having cooled
the body . . . near-normal evaporation process. The next two layers . . . "
Kynes tightened the chest fit. ". . . include heat exchange filaments and salt
precipitators. Salt's reclaimed."
The Duke lifted his arms at a gesture, said: "Most interesting."
"Breathe deeply," Kynes said.
The Duke obeyed.
Kynes studied the underarm seals, adjusted one. "Motions of the body,
especially breathing," he said, "and some osmotic action provide the pumping
force." He loosened the chest fit slightly. "Reclaimed water circulates to
catchpockets from which you draw it through this tube in the clip at your neck."
The Duke twisted his chin in and down to look at the end of the tube.
"Efficient and convenient," he said. "Good engineering."
Kynes knelt, examined the leg seals. "Urine and feces are processed in the
thigh pads," he said, and stood up, felt the neck fitting, lifted a sectioned
flap there. "In the open desert, you wear this filter across your face, this
tube in the nostrils with these plugs to insure a tight fit. Breathe in through
the mouth filter, out through the nose tube. With a Fremen suit in good working
order, you won't lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a day--even if you're
caught in the Great Erg."
"A thimbleful a day," the Duke said.
Kynes pressed a finger against the suit's forehead pad, said: "This may rub
a little. It if irritates you, please tell me. I could slit-patch it a bit
tighter."
"My thanks," the Duke said. He moved his shoulders in the suit as Kynes
stepped back, realizing that it did feel better now--tighter and less
irritating.
Kynes turned to Paul. "Now, let's have a look at you, lad."
A good man but he'll have to learn to address us properly, the Duke thought.
Paul stood passively as Kynes inspected the suit. It had been an odd
sensation putting on the crinkling, slick-surfaced garment. In his
foreconsciousness had been the absolute knowledge that he had never before worn
a stillsuit. Yet, each motion of adjusting the adhesion tabs under Gurney's
inexpert guidance had seemed natural, instinctive. When he had tightened the
chest to gain maximum pumping action from the motion of breathing, he had known
what he did and why. When he had fitted the neck and forehead tabs tightly, he
had known it was to prevent friction blisters.
Kynes straightened, stepped back with a puzzled expression. "You've worn a
stillsuit before?" he asked.
"This is the first time."
"Then someone adjusted it for you?"
"No."
"Your desert boots are fitted slip-fashion at the ankles. Who told you to do
that?"
"It . . . seemed the right way."
"That it most certainly is."
And Kynes rubbed his cheek, thinking of the legend: "He shall know your ways
as though born to them."
"We waste time," the Duke said. He gestured to the waiting 'thopter, led the
way, accepting the guard's salute with a nod. He climbed in, fastened his safety
harness, checked controls and instruments. The craft creaked as the others
clambered aboard.
Kynes fastened his harness, focused on the padded comfort of the aircraft-soft luxury of gray-green upholstery, gleaming instruments, the sensation of
filtered and washed air in his lungs as doors slammed and vent fans whirred
alive.
So soft! he thought.
"All secure, Sire," Halleck said.
Leto fed power to the wings, felt them cup and dip--once, twice. They were
airborne in ten meters, wings feathered tightly and afterjets thrusting them
upward in a steep, hissing climb.
"Southeast over the Shield Wall," Kynes said. "That's where I told your
sandmaster to concentrate his equipment."
"Right."
The Duke banked into his air cover, the other craft taking up their guard
positions as they headed southeast.
"The design and manufacture of these stillsuits bespeaks a high degree of
sophistication," the Duke said.
"Someday I may show you a sietch factory," Kynes said.

"I would find that interesting," the Duke said. "I note that suits are
manufactured also in some of the garrison cities."
"Inferior copies," Kynes said. "Any Dune man who values his skin wears a
Fremen suit."
"And it'll hold your water loss to a thimbleful a day?"
"Properly suited, your forehead cap tight, all seals in order, your major
water loss is through the palms of your hands," Kynes said. "You can wear suit
gloves if you're not using your hands for critical work, but most Fremen in the
open desert rub their hands with juice from the leaves of the creosote bush. It
inhibits perspiration."
The Duke glanced down to the left at the broken landscape of the Shield
Wall--chasms of tortured rock, patches of yellow-brown crossed by black lines of
fault shattering. It was as though someone had dropped this ground from space
and left it where it smashed.
They crossed a shallow basin with the clear outline of gray sand spreading
across it from a canyon opening to the south. The sand fingers ran out into the
basin--a dry delta outlined against darker rock.
Kynes sat back, thinking about the water-fat flesh he had felt beneath the
stillsuits. They wore shield belts over their robes, slow pellet stunners at the
waist, coin-sized emergency transmitters on cords around their necks. Both the
Duke and his son carried knives in wrist sheathes and the sheathes appeared well
worn. The people struck Kynes as a strange combination of softness and armed
strength. There was a poise to them totally unlike the Harkonnens.
"When you report to the Emperor on the change of government here, will you
say we observed the rules?" Leto asked. He glanced at Kynes, back to their
course.
"The Harkonnens left; you came," Kynes said.
"And is everything as it should be?" Leto asked.
Momentary tension showed in the tightening of a muscle along Kynes' jaw. "As
Planetologist and Judge of the Change, I am a direct subject of the Imperium . .
. my Lord."
The Duke smiled grimly. "But we both know the realities."
"I remind you that His Majesty supports my work."
"Indeed? And what is your work?"
In the brief silence, Paul thought: He's pushing this Kynes too hard. Paul
glanced at Halleck, but the minstrel-warrior was staring out at the barren
landscape.
Kynes spoke stiffly: "You, of course, refer to my duties as planetologist."
"Of course."
"It is mostly dry land biology and botany . . . some geological work--core
drilling and testing. You never really exhaust the possibilities of an entire
planet."
"Do you also investigate the spice?"
Kynes turned, and Paul noted the hard line of the man's cheek. "A curious
question, my Lord."
"Bear in mind, Kynes, that this is now my fief. My methods differ from those
of the Harkonnens. I don't care if you study the spice as long as I share what
you discover." He glanced at the planetologist. "The Harkonnens discouraged
investigation of the spice, didn't they?"
Kynes stared back without answering.
"You may speak plainly," the Duke said, "without fear for your skin."
"The Imperial Court is, indeed, a long way off," Kynes muttered. And he
thought: What does this water-soft invader expect? Does he think me fool enough
to enlist with him?
The Duke chuckled, keeping his attention on their course. "I detect a sour
note in your voice, sir. We've waded in here with our mob of tame killers, eh?

And we expect you to realize immediately that we're different from the
Harkonnens?"
"I've seen the propaganda you've flooded into sietch and village," Kynes
said. " 'Love the good Duke!' Your corps of--"
"Here now!" Halleck barked. He snapped his attention away from the window,
leaned forward.
Paul put a hand on Halleck's arm.
"Gurney!" the Duke said. He glanced back. "This man's been long under the
Harkonnens."
Halleck sat back. "Ayah."
"Your man Hawat's subtle," Kynes said, "but his object's plain enough."
"Will you open those bases to us, then?" the Duke asked.
Kynes spoke curtly: "They're His Majesty's property."
"They're not being used."
"They could be used."
"Does His Majesty concur?"
Kynes darted a hard stare at the Duke. "Arrakis could be an Eden if its
rulers would look up from grubbing for spice!"
He didn't answer my question, the Duke thought. And he said: "How is a
planet to become an Eden without money?"
"What is money," Kynes asked, "if it won't buy the services you need?"
Ah, now! the Duke thought. And he said: "We'll discuss this another time.
Right now, I believe we're coming to the edge of the Shield Wall. Do I hold the
same course?"
"The same course," Kynes muttered.
Paul looked out his window. Beneath them, the broken ground began to drop
away in tumbled creases toward a barren rock plain and a knife-edged shelf.
Beyond the shelf, fingernail crescents of dunes marched toward the horizon with
here and there in the distance a dull smudge, a darker blotch to tell of
something not sand. Rock outcroppings, perhaps. In the heat-addled air, Paul
couldn't be sure.
"Are there any plants down there?" Paul asked.
"Some," Kynes said. "This latitude's life-zone has mostly what we call minor
water stealers--adapted to raiding each other for moisture, gobbling up the
trace-dew. Some parts of the desert teem with life. But all of it has learned
how to survive under these rigors. If you get caught down there, you imitate
that life or you die."
"You mean steal water from each other?" Paul asked. The idea outraged him,
and his voice betrayed his emotion.
"It's done," Kynes said, "but that wasn't precisely my meaning. You see, my
climate demands a special attitude toward water. You are aware of water at all
times. You waste nothing that contains moisture."
And the Duke thought: " . . . my climate!"
"Come around two degrees more southerly, my Lord," Kynes said. "There's a
blow coming up from the west."
The Duke nodded. He had seen the billowing of tan dust there. He banked the
'thopter around, noting the way the escort's wings reflected milky orange from
the dust-refracted light as they turned to keep pace with him.
"This should clear the storm's edge," Kynes said.
"That sand must be dangerous if you fly into it," Paul said. "Will it really
cut the strongest metals?"
"At this altitude, it's not sand but dust," Kynes said. "The danger is lack
of visibility, turbulence, clogged intakes."
"We'll see actual spice mining today?" Paul asked.
"Very likely," Kynes said.
Paul sat back. He had used the questions and hyperawareness to do what his
mother called "registering" the person. He had Kynes now--tune of voice, each
detail of face and gesture. An unnatural folding of the left sleeve on the man's
robe told of a knife in an arm sheath. The waist bulged strangely. It was said
that desert men wore a belted sash into which they tucked small necessities.
Perhaps the bulges came from such a sash--certainly not from a concealed shield
belt. A copper pin engraved with the likeness of a hare clasped the neck of
Kynes' robe. Another smaller pin with similar likeness hung at the corner of the
hood which was thrown back over his shoulders.
Halleck twisted in the seat beside Paul, reached back into the rear
compartment and brought out his baliset. Kynes looked around as Halleck tuned
the instrument, then returned his attention to their course.
"What would you like to hear, young Master?" Halleck asked.
"You choose, Gurney," Paul said.
Halleck bent his ear close to the sounding board, strummed a chord and sang
softly:
"Our fathers ate manna in the desert,
In the burning places where whirlwinds came.
Lord, save us from that horrible land!
Save us . . . oh-h-h-h, save us
From the dry and thirsty land."
Kynes glanced at the Duke, said: "You do travel with a light complement of
guards, my Lord. Are all of them such men of many talents?"
"Gurney?" The Duke chuckled. "Gurney's one of a kind. I like him with me for
his eyes. His eyes miss very little."
The planetologist frowned.
Without missing a beat in his tune, Halleck interposed:
"For I am like an owl of the desert, o!
Aiyah! am like an owl of the des-ert!"
The Duke reached down, brought up a microphone from the instrument panel,
thumbed it to life, said: "Leader to Escort Gemma. Flying object at nine
o'clock, Sector B. Do you identify it?"
"It's merely a bird," Kynes said, and added: "You have sharp eyes."
The panel speaker crackled, then: "Escort Gemma. Object examined under full
amplification. It's a large bird."
Paul looked in the indicated direction, saw the distant speck: a dot of
intermittent motion, and realized how keyed up his father must be. Every sense
was at full alert.
"I'd not realized there were birds that large this far into the desert," the
Duke said.
"That's likely an eagle," Kynes said. "Many creatures have adapted to this
place."
The ornithopter swept over a bare rock plain. Paul looked down from their
two thousand meters' altitude, saw the wrinkled shadow of their craft and
escort. The land beneath seemed flat, but shadow wrinkles said otherwise.
"Has anyone ever walked out of the desert?" the Duke asked.
Halleck's music stopped. He leaned forward to catch the answer.
"Not from the deep desert," Kynes said. "Men have walked out of the second
zone several times. They've survived by crossing the rock areas where worms
seldom go."
The timbre of Kynes' voice held Paul's attention. He felt his sense come
alert the way they were trained to do.
"Ah-h, the worms," the Duke said. "I must see one sometime."
"You may see one today," Kynes said. "Wherever there is spice, there are
worms."
"Always?" Halleck asked.
"Always."
"Is there relationship between worm and spice?" the Duke asked.
Kynes turned and Paul saw the pursed lips as the man spoke. "They defend
spice sands. Each worm has a--territory. As to the spice . . . who knows? Worm
specimens we've examined lead us to suspect complicated chemical interchanges
within them. We find traces of hydrochloric acid in the ducts, more complicated
acid forms elsewhere. I'll give you my monograph on the subject."
"And a shield's no defense?" the Duke asked.
"Shields!" Kynes sneered. "Activate a shield within the worm zone and you
seal your fate. Worms ignore territory lines, come from far around to attack a
shield. No man wearing a shield has ever survived such attack."
"How are worms taken, then?"
"High voltage electrical shock applied separately to each ring segment is
the only known way of killing and preserving an entire worm," Kynes said. "They
can be stunned and shattered by explosives, but each ring segment has a life of
its own. Barring atomics, I know of no explosive powerful enough to destroy a
large worm entirely. They're incredibly tough."
"Why hasn't an effort been made to wipe them out?" Paul asked.
"Too expensive," Kynes said. "Too much area to cover."
Paul leaned back in his corner. His truthsense, awareness of tone shadings,
told him that Kynes was lying and telling half-truths. And he thought: If
there's a relationship between spice and worms, killing the worms would destroy
the spice.
"No one will have to walk out of the desert soon," the Duke said. "Trip
these little transmitters at our necks and rescue is on its way. All our workers
will be wearing them before long. We're setting up a special rescue service."
"Very commendable," Kynes said.
"Your tone says you don't agree," the Duke said.
"Agree? Of course I agree, but it won't be much use. Static electricity from
sandstorms masks out many signals. Transmitters short out. They've been tried
here before, you know. Arrakis is tough on equipment. And if a worm's hunting
you there's not much time. Frequently, you have no more than fifteen or twenty
minutes."
"What would you advise?" the Duke asked.
"You ask my advice?"
"As planetologist, yes."
"You'd follow my advice?"
"If I found it sensible."
"Very well, my Lord. Never travel alone."
The Duke turned his attention from the controls. "That's all?"
"That's all. Never travel alone."
"What if you're separated by a storm and forced down?" Halleck asked. "Isn't
there anything you could do?"
"Any thing covers much territory," Kynes said.
"What would you do?" Paul asked.
Kynes turned a hard stare at the boy, brought his attention back to the
Duke. "I'd remember to protect the integrity of my stillsuit. If I were outside
the worm zone or in rock, I'd stay with the ship. If I were down in open sand,
I'd get away from the ship as fast as I could. About a thousand meters would be
far enough. Then I'd hide beneath my robe. A worm would get the ship, but it
might miss me."
"Then what?" Halleck asked.
Kynes shrugged. "Wait for the worm to leave."
"That's all?" Paul asked.

"When the worm has gone, one may try to walk out," Kynes said. "You must
walk softly, avoid drum sands, tidal dust basins--head for the nearest rock
zone. There are many such zones. You might make it."
"Drum sand?" Halleck asked.
"A condition of sand compaction," Kynes said. "The slightest step sets it
drumming. Worms always come to that."
"And a tidal dust basin?" the Duke asked.
"Certain depressions in the desert have filled with dust over the centuries.
Some are so vast they have currents and tides. All will swallow the unwary who
step into them."
Halleck sat back, resumed strumming the baliset. Presently, he sang:
"Wild beasts of the desert do hunt there,
Waiting for the innocents to pass.
Oh-h-h, tempt not the gods of the desert,
Lest you seek a lonely epitaph.
The perils of the--"
He broke off, leaned forward. "Dust cloud ahead, Sire."
"I see it, Gurney."
"That's what we seek," Kynes said.
Paul stretched up in the seat to peer ahead, saw a rolling yellow cloud low
on the desert surface some thirty kilometers ahead.
"One of your factory crawlers," Kynes said. "It's on the surface and that
means it's on spice. The cloud is vented sand being expelled after the spice has
been centrifugally removed. There's no other cloud quite like it."
"Aircraft over it," the Duke said.
"I see two . . . three . . . four spotters," Kynes said. "They're watching
for wormsign."
"Wormsign?" the Duke asked.
"A sandwave moving toward the crawler. They'll have seismic probes on the
surface, too. Worms sometimes travel too deep for the wave to show." Kynes swung
his gaze around the sky. "Should be a carryall wing around, but I don't see it."
"The worm always comes, eh?" Halleck asked.
"Always."
Paul leaned forward, touched Kynes' shoulder. "How big an area does each
worm stake out?"
Kynes frowned. The child kept asking adult questions.
"That depends on the size of the worm."
"What's the variation?" the Duke asked.
"Big ones may control three or four hundred square kilometers. Small ones--"
He broke off as the Duke kicked on the jet brakes. The ship bucked as its tail
pods whispered to silence. Stub wings elongated, cupped the air. The craft
became a full 'thopter as the Duke banked it, holding the wings to a gentle
beat, pointing with his left hand off to the east beyond the factory crawler.
"Is that wormsign?"
Kynes leaned across the Duke to peer into the distance.
Paul and Halleck were crowded together, looking in the same direction, and
Paul noted that their escort, caught by the sudden maneuver, had surged ahead,
but now was curving back. The factory crawler lay ahead of them, still some
three kilometers away.
Where the Duke pointed, crescent dune tracks spread shadow ripples toward
the horizon and, running through them as a level line stretching into the
distance, came an elongated mount-in-motion--a cresting of sand. It reminded
Paul of the way a big fish disturbed the water when swimming just under the
surface.

"Worm," Kynes said. "Big one." He leaned back, grabbed the microphone from
the panel, punched out a new frequency selection. Glancing at the grid chart on
rollers over their heads, he spoke into the microphone: "Calling crawler at
Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign warning. Crawler at Delta Ajax niner. Wormsign
warning. Acknowledge, please." He waited.
The panel speaker emitted static crackles, then a voice: "Who calls Delta
Ajax niner? Over."
"They seem pretty calm about it," Halleck said.
Kynes spoke into the microphone: "Unlisted flight--north and east of you
about three kilometers. Wormsign is on intercept course, your position,
estimated contact twenty-five minutes."
Another voice rumbled from the speaker: "This is Spotter Control. Sighting
confirmed. Stand by for contact fix." There was a pause, then: "Contact in
twenty-six minutes minus. That was a sharp estimate. Who's on that unlisted
flight? Over."
Halleck had his harness off and surged forward between Kynes and the Duke.
"Is this the regular working frequency, Kynes?"
"Yes. Why?"
"Who'd be listening?"
"Just the work crews in this area. Cuts down interference."
Again, the speaker crackled, then: "This is Delta Ajax niner. Who gets bonus
credit for that spot? Over."
Halleck glanced at the Duke.
Kynes said: "There's a bonus based on spice load for whoever gives first
worm warning. They want to know--"
"Tell them who had first sight of that worm," Halleck said.
The Duke nodded.
Kynes hesitated, then lifted the microphone; "Spotter credit to the Duke
Leto Atreides. The Duke Leto Atreides. Over."
The voice from the speaker was flat and partly distorted by a burst of
static: "We read and thank you."
"Now, tell them to divide the bonus among themselves," Halleck ordered.
"Tell them it's the Duke's wish."
Kynes took a deep breath, then: "It's the Duke's wish that you divide the
bonus among your crew. Do you read? Over."
"Acknowledged and thank you," the speaker said.
The Duke said: "I forgot to mention that Gurney is also very talented in
public relations."
Kynes turned a puzzled frown on Halleck.
"This lets the men know their Duke is concerned for their safety," Halleck
said. "Word will get around. It was on an area working frequency--not likely
Harkonnen agents heard." He glanced out at their air cover. "And we're a pretty
strong force. It was a good risk."
The Duke banked their craft toward the sandcloud erupting from the factory
crawler. "What happens now?"
"There's a carryall wing somewhere close," Kynes said. "It'll come in and
lift off the crawler."
"What if the carryall's wrecked?" Halleck asked.
"Some equipment is lost," Kynes said. "Get in close over the crawler, my
Lord; you'll find this interesting."
The Duke scowled, busied himself with the controls as they came into
turbulent air over the crawler.
Paul looked down, saw sand still spewing out of the metal and plastic
monster beneath them. It looked like a great tan and blue beetle with many wide
tracks extending on arms around it. He saw a giant inverted funnel snout poked
into dark sand in front of it.

"Rich spice bed by the color," Kynes said. "They'll continue working until
the last minute."
The Duke fed more power to the wings, stiffened them for a steeper descent
as he settled lower in a circling glide above the crawler. A glance left and
right showed his cover holding altitude and circling overhead.
Paul studied the yellow cloud belching from the crawler's pipe vents, looked
out over the desert at the approaching worm track.
"Shouldn't we be hearing them call in the carryall?" Halleck asked.
"They usually have the wing on a different frequency," Kynes said.
"Shouldn't they have two carryalls standing by for every crawler?" the Duke
asked. "There should be twenty-six men on that machine down there, not to
mention cost of equipment."
Kynes said: "You don't have enough ex--"
He broke off as the speaker erupted with an angry voice: "Any of you see the
wing? He isn't answering."
A garble of noise crackled from the speaker, drowned in an abrupt override
signal, then silence and the first voice: "Report by the numbers! Over."
"This is Spotter Control. Last I saw, the wing was pretty high and circling
off northwest. I don't see him now. Over."
"Spotter one: negative. Over."
"Spotter two: negative. Over."
"Spotter three: negative. Over."
Silence.
The Duke looked down. His own craft's shadow was just passing over the
crawler. "Only four spotters, is that right?"
"Correct," Kynes said.
"There are five in our party," the Duke said. "Our ships are larger. We can
crowd in three extra each. Their spotters ought to be able to lift off two
each."
Paul did the mental arithmetic, said: "That's three short."
"Why don't they have two carryalls to each crawler?" barked the Duke.
"You don't have enough extra equipment," Kynes said.
"All the more reason we should protect what we have!"
"Where could that carryall go?" Halleck asked.
"Could've been forced down somewhere out of sight," Kynes said.
The Duke grabbed the microphone, hesitated with thumb poised over its
switch. "How could they lose sight of a carryall?"
"They keep their attention on the ground looking for wormsign," Kynes said.
The Duke thumbed the switch, spoke into the microphone. "This is your Duke.
We are coming down to take off Delta Ajax niner's crew. All spotters are ordered
to comply. Spotters will land on the east side. We will take the west. Over." He
reached down, punched out his own command frequency, repeated the order for his
own air cover, handed the microphone back to Kynes.
Kynes returned to the working frequency and a voice blasted from the
speaker: " . . . almost a full load of spice! We have almost a full load! We
can't leave that for a damned worm! Over."
"Damn the spice!" the Duke barked. He grabbed back the microphone, said: "We
can always get more spice. There are seats in our ships for all but three of
you. Draw straws or decide any way you like who's to go. But you're going, and
that's an order!" He slammed the microphone back into Kynes' hands, muttered:
"Sorry," as Kynes shook an injured finger.
"How much time?" Paul asked.
"Nine minutes," Kynes said.
The Duke said: "This ship has more power than the others. If we took off
under jet with three-quarter wings, we could crowd in an additional man."
"That sand's soft," Kynes said.

"With four extra men aboard on a jet takeoff, we could snap the wings,
Sire," Halleck said.
"Not on this ship," the Duke said. He hauled back on the controls as the
'thopter glided in beside the crawler. The wings tipped up, braked the 'thopter
to a skidding stop within twenty meters of the factory.
The crawler was silent now, no sand spouting from its vents. Only a faint
mechanical rumble issued from it, becoming more audible as the Duke opened his
door.
Immediately, their nostrils were assailed by the odor of cinnamon--heavy and
pungent.
With a loud flapping, the spotter aircraft glided down to the sand on the
other side of the crawler. The Duke's own escort swooped in to land in line with
him.
Paul, looking out at the factory, saw how all the 'thopters were dwarfed by
it--gnats beside a warrior beetle.
"Gurney, you and Paul toss out that rear seat," the Duke said. He manually
cranked the wings out to three-quarters, set their angle, checked the jet pod
controls. "Why the devil aren't they coming out of that machine?"
"They're hoping the carryall will show up," Kynes said. "They still have a
few minutes." He glanced off to the east.
All turned to look the same direction, seeing no sign of the worm, but there
was a heavy, charged feeling of anxiety in the air.
The Duke took the microphone, punched for his command frequency, said: "Two
of you toss out your shield generators. By the numbers. You can carry one more
man that way. We're not leaving any men for that monster." He keyed back to the
working frequency, barked: "All right, you in Delta Ajax niner! Out! Now! This
is a command from your Duke! On the double or I'll cut that crawler apart with a
lasgun!"
A hatch snapped open near the front of the factory, another at the rear,
another at the top. Men came tumbling out, sliding and scrambling down to the
sand. A tall man in a patched working robe was the last to emerge. He jumped
down to a track and then to the sand.
The Duke hung the microphone on the panel, swung out onto the wing step,
shouted: "Two men each into your spotters."
The man in the patched robe began lolling off pairs of his crew, pushing
them toward the craft waiting on the other side.
"Four over here!" the Duke shouted. "Four into that ship back there!" He
jabbed a finger at an escort 'thopter directly behind him. The guards were just
wrestling the shield generator out of it. "And four into that ship over there!"
He pointed to the other escort that had shed its shield generator. "Three each
into the others! Run, you sand dogs!"
The tall man finished counting off his crew, came slogging across the sand
followed by three of his companions.
"I hear the worm, but I can't see it," Kynes said.
The others heard it then--an abrasive slithering, distant and growing
louder.
"Damn sloppy way to operate," the Duke muttered.
Aircraft began flapping off the sand around them. It reminded the Duke of a
time in his home planet's jungles, a sudden emergence into a clearing, and
carrion birds lifting away from the carcass of a wild ox.
The spice workers slogged up to the side of the 'thopter, started climbing
in behind the Duke. Halleck helped, dragging them into the rear.
"In you go, boys!" he snapped. "On the double!"
Paul, crowded into a corner by sweating men, smelled the perspiration of
fear, saw that two of the men had poor neck adjustments on their stillsuits. He
filed the information in his memory for future action. His father would have to
order tighter stillsuit discipline. Men tended to become sloppy if you didn't
watch such things.
The last man came gasping into the rear, said. "The worm! It's almost on us!
Blast off!"
The Duke slid into his seat, frowning, said: "We still have almost three
minutes on the original contact estimate. Is that right, Kynes?" He shut his
door, checked it.
"Almost exactly, my Lord," Kynes said, and he thought: A cool one, this
duke.
"All secure here, Sire," Halleck said.
The Duke nodded, watched the last of his escort take off. He adjusted the
igniter, glanced once more at wings and instruments, punched the jet sequence.
The take-off pressed the Duke and Kynes deep into their seats, compressed
the people in the rear. Kynes watched the way the Duke handled the controls-gently, surely. The 'thopter was fully airborne now, and the Duke studied his
instruments, glanced left and right at his wings.
"She's very heavy, Sire," Halleck said.
"Well within the tolerances of this ship," the Duke said. "You didn't really
think I'd risk this cargo, did you, Gurney?"
Halleck grinned, said: "Not a bit of it, Sire."
The Duke banked his craft in a long easy curve--climbing over the crawler.
Paul, crushed into a corner beside a window, stared down at the silent
machine on the sand. The wormsign had broken off about four hundred meters from
the crawler. And now, there appeared to be turbulence in the sand around the
factory.
"The worm is now beneath the crawler," Kynes said. "You are about to witness
a thing few have seen."
Flecks of dust shadowed the sand around the crawler now. The big machine
began to tip down to the right. A gigantic sand whirlpool began forming there to
the right of the crawler. It moved faster and faster. Sand and dust filled the
air now for hundreds of meters around.
Then they saw it!
A wide hole emerged from the sand. Sunlight flashed from glistening white
spokes within it. The hole's diameter was at least twice the length of the
crawler, Paul estimated. He watched as the machine slid into that opening in a
billow of dust and sand. The hole pulled back.
"Gods, what a monster!" muttered a man beside Paul.
"Got all our floggin' spice!" growled another.
"Someone is going to pay for this," the Duke said. "I promise you that."
By the very flatness of his father's voice, Paul sensed the deep anger. He
found that he shared it. This was criminal waste!
In the silence that followed, they heard Kynes.
"Bless the Maker and His water," Kynes murmured. "Bless the coming and going
of Him. May His passage cleanse the world. May He keep the world for His
people."
"What's that you're saying?" the Duke asked.
But Kynes remained silent.
Paul glanced at the men crowded around him. They were staring fearfully at
the back of Kynes' head. One of them whispered: "Liet."
Kynes turned, scowling. The man sank back, abashed.
Another of the rescued men began coughing--dry and rasping. Presently, he
gasped: "Curse this hell hole!"
The tall Dune man who had come last out of the crawler said; "Be you still,
Coss. You but worsen your cough." He stirred among the men until he could look
through them at the back of the Duke's head. "You be the Duke Leto, I warrant,"
he said. "It's to you we give thanks for our lives. We were ready to end it
there until you came along."
"Quiet, man, and let the Duke fly his ship," Halleck muttered.
Paul glanced at Halleck. He, too, had seen the tension wrinkles at the
corner of his father's jaw. One walked softly when the Duke was in a rage.
Leto began easing his 'thopter out of its great banking circle, stopped at a
new sign of movement on the sand. The worm had withdrawn into the depths and
now, near where the crawler had been, two figures could be seen moving north
away from the sand depression. They appeared to glide over the surface with
hardly a lifting of dust to mark their passage.
"Who's that down there?" the Duke barked.
"Two Johnnies who came along for the ride, Soor," said the tall Dune man.
"Why wasn't something said about them?"
"It was the chance they took, Soor," the Dune man said.
"My Lord," said Kynes, "these men know it's of little use to do anything
about men trapped on the desert in worm country."
"We'll send a ship from base for them!" the Duke snapped.
"As you wish, my Lord," Kynes said. "But likely when the ship gets here
there'll be no one to rescue."
"We'll send a ship, anyway," the Duke said.
"They were right beside where the worm came up," Paul said. "How'd they
escape?"
"The sides of the hole cave in and make the distances deceptive," Kynes
said.
"You waste fuel here, Sire," Halleck ventured.
"Aye, Gurney."
The Duke brought his craft around toward the Shield Wall. His escort came
down from circling stations, took up positions above and on both sides.
Paul thought about what the Dune man and Kynes had said. He sensed halftruths, outright lies. The men on the sand had glided across the surface so
surely, moving in a way obviously calculated to keep from luring the worm back
out of its depths.
Fremen! Paul thought. Who else would be so sure on the sand? Who else might
be left out of your worries as a matter of course--because they are in no
danger? They know how to live here! They know how to outwit the worm!
"What were Fremen doing on that crawler?" Paul asked.
Kynes whirled.
The tall Dune man turned wide eyes on Paul--blue within blue within blue.
"Who be this lad?" he asked.
Halleck moved to place himself between the man and Paul, said: "This is Paul
Atreides, the ducal heir."
"Why says he there were Fremen on our rumbler?" the man asked.
"They fit the description," Paul said.
Kynes snorted. "You can't tell Fremen just by looking at them!" He looked at
the Dune man. "You. Who were those men?"
"Friends of one of the others," the Dune man said. "Just friends from a
village who wanted to see the spice sands."
Kynes turned away. "Fremen!"
But he was remembering the words of the legend: "The Lisan al-Gaib shall see
through all subterfuge."
"They be dead now, most likely, young Soor," the Dune man said. "We should
not speak unkindly on them."
But Paul heard the falsehood in their voices, felt the menace that had
brought Halleck instinctively into guarding position.
Paul spoke dryly: "A terrible place for them to die."
Without turning, Kynes said; "When God hath ordained a creature to die in a
particular place. He causeth that creature's wants to direct him to that place."
Leto turned a hard stare at Kynes.

And Kynes, returning the stare, found himself troubled by a fact he had
observed here: This Duke was concerned more over the men that he was over the
spice. He risked his own life and that of his son to save the men. He passed off
the loss of a spice crawler with a gesture. The threat to men's lives had him in
a rage. A leader such as that would command fanatic loyalty. He would be
difficult to defeat.
Against his own will and all previous judgments, Kynes admitted to himself:
I like this Duke.

Greatness is a transitory experience. It is never consistent. It depends in part
upon the myth-making imagination of humankind. The person who experiences
greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in. He must reflect what is
projected upon him. And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic. This is
what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions. The sardonic is all that
permits him to move within himself. Without this quality, even occasional
greatness will destroy a man.
-from "Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
In the dining hall of the Arrakeen great house, suspensor lamps had been
lighted against the early dark. They cast their yellow glows upward onto the
black bull's head with its bloody horns, and onto the darkly glistening oil
painting of the Old Duke.
Beneath these talismans, white linen shone around the burnished reflections
of the Atreides silver, which had been placed in precise arrangements along the
great table--little archipelagos of service waiting beside crystal glasses, each
setting squared off before a heavy wooden chair. The classic central chandelier
remained unlighted, and its chain twisted upward into shadows where the
mechanism of the poison-snooper had been concealed.
Pausing in the doorway to inspect the arrangements, the Duke thought about
the poison-snooper and what it signified in his society.
All of a pattern, he thought. You can plumb us by our language--the precise
and delicate delineations for ways to administer treacherous death. Will someone
try chaumurky tonight--poison in the drink? Or will it be chaumas--poison in the
food?
He shook his head.
Beside each plate on the long table stood a flagon of water. There was
enough water along the table, the Duke estimated, to keep a poor Arrakeen family
for more than a year.
Flanking the doorway in which he stood were broad laving basins of ornate
yellow and green tile. Each basin had its rack of towels. It was the custom, the
housekeeper had explained, for guests as they entered to dip their hands
ceremoniously into a basin, slop several cups of water onto the floor, dry their
hands on a towel and fling the towel into the growing puddle at the door. After
the dinner, beggars gathered outside to get the water squeezings from the
towels.
How typical of a Harkonnen fief, the Duke thought. Every degradation of the
spirit that can be conceived. He took a deep breath, feeling rage tighten his
stomach.
"The custom stops here!" he muttered.
He saw a serving woman--one of the old and gnarled ones the housekeeper had
recommended--hovering at the doorway from the kitchen across from him. The Duke
signaled with upraised hand. She moved out of the shadows, scurried around the
table toward him, and he noted the leathery face, the blue-within-blue eyes.
"My Lord wishes?" She kept her head bowed, eyes shielded.
He gestured. "Have these basins and towels removed."
"But . . . Noble Born . . ." She looked up, mouth gaping.
"I know the custom!" he barked. "Take these basins to the front door. While
we're eating and until we've finished, each beggar who calls may have a full cup
of water. Understood?"
Her leathery face displayed a twisting of emotions: dismay, anger . . .
With sudden insight, Leto realized that she must have planned to sell the
water squeezings from the foot-trampled towels, wringing a few coppers from the
wretches who came to the door. Perhaps that also was a custom.
His face clouded, and he growled: "I'm posting a guard to see that my orders
are carried out to the letter."
He whirled, strode back down the passage to the Great Hall. Memories rolled
in his mind like the toothless mutterings of old women. He remembered open water
and waves--days of grass instead of sand--dazed summers that had whipped past
him like windstorm leaves.
All gone.
I'm getting old, he thought. I've felt the cold hand of my mortality. And in
what? An old woman's greed.
In the Great Hall, the Lady Jessica was the center of a mixed group standing
in front of the fireplace. An open blaze crackled there, casting flickers of
orange light onto jewels and laces and costly fabrics. He recognized in the
group a stillsuit manufacturer down from Carthag, an electronics equipment
importer, a water-shipper whose summer mansion was near his polar-cap factory, a
representative of the Guild Bank (lean and remote, that one), a dealer in
replacement parts for spice mining equipment, a thin and hard-faced woman whose
escort service for off-planet visitors reputedly operated as cover for various
smuggling, spying, and blackmail operations.
Most of the women in the hall seemed cast from a specific type--decorative,
precisely turned out, an odd mingling of untouchable sensuousness.
Even without her position as hostess, Jessica would have dominated the
group, he thought. She wore no jewelry and had chosen warm colors--a long dress
almost the shade of the open blaze, and an earth-brown band around her bronzed
hair.
He realized she had done this to taunt him subtly, a reproof against his
recent pose of coldness. She was well aware that he liked her best in these
shades--that he saw her as a rustling of warm colors.
Nearby, more an outflanker than a member of the group, stood Duncan Idaho in
glittering dress uniform, flat face unreadable, the curling black hair neatly
combed. He had been summoned back from the Fremen and had his orders from Hawat-"Under pretext of guarding her, you will keep the Lady Jessica under constant
surveillance."
The Duke glanced around the room.
There was Paul in the corner surrounded by a fawning group of the younger
Arrakeen richece, and, aloof among them, three officers of the House Troop. The
Duke took particular note of the young women. What a catch a ducal heir would
make. But Paul was treating all equally with an air of reserved nobility.
He'll wear the title well, the Duke thought, and realized with a sudden
chill that this was another death thought.
Paul saw his father in the doorway, avoided his eyes. He looked around at
the clusterings of guests, the jeweled hands clutching drinks (and the
unobtrusive inspections with tiny remote-cast snoopers). Seeing all the
chattering faces, Paul was suddenly repelled by them. They were cheap masks
locked on festering thoughts--voices gabbling to drown out the loud silence in
every breast.
I'm in a sour mood, he thought, and wondered what Gurney would say to that.
He knew his mood's source. He hadn't wanted to attend this function, but his
father had been firm. "You have a place--a position to uphold. You're old enough
to do this. You're almost a man."
Paul saw his father emerge from the doorway, inspect the room, then cross to
the group around the Lady Jessica.
As Leto approached Jessica's group, the water-shipper was asking: "Is it
true the Duke will put in weather control?"
From behind the man, the Duke said: "We haven't gone that far in our
thinking, sir."
The man turned, exposing a bland round face, darkly tanned. "Ah-h, the
Duke," he said. "We missed you."
Leto glanced at Jessica. "A thing needed doing." He returned his attention
to the water-shipper, explained what he had ordered for the laving basins,
adding: "As far as I'm concerned, the old custom ends now."
"Is this a ducal order, m'Lord?" the man asked.
"I leave that to your own . . . ah . . . conscience," the Duke said. He
turned, noting Kynes come up to the group.
One of the women said: "I think it's a very generous gesture--giving water
to the--" Someone shushed her.
The Duke looked at Kynes, noting that the planetologist wore an old-style
dark brown uniform with epaulets of the Imperial Civil Servant and a tiny gold
teardrop of rank at his collar.
The water-shipper asked in an angry voice: "Does the Duke imply criticism of
our custom?"
"This custom has been changed," Leto said. He nodded to Kynes, marked the
frown on Jessica's face, thought: A frown does not become her, but it'll
increase rumors of friction between us.
"With the Duke's permission," the water-shipper said, "I'd like to inquire
further about customs."
Leto heard the sudden oily tone in the man's voice, noted the watchful
silence in this group, the way heads were beginning to turn toward them around
the room.
"Isn't it almost time for dinner?" Jessica asked.
"But our guest has some questions," Leto said. And he looked at the watershipper, seeing a round-faced man with large eyes and thick lips, recalling
Hawat's memorandum: ". . . and this water-shipper is a man to watch--Lingar
Bewt, remember the name. The Harkonnens used him but never fully controlled
him."
"Water customs are so interesting," Bewt said, and there was a smile on his
face. "I'm curious what you intend about the conservatory attached to this
house. Do you intend to continue flaunting it in the people's faces . . .
m'Lord?"
Leto held anger in check, staring at the man. Thoughts raced through his
mind. It had taken bravery to challenge him in his own ducal castle, especially
since they now had Bewt's signature over a contract of allegiance. The action
had taken, also, a knowledge of personal power. Water was, indeed, power here.
If water facilities were mined, for instance, ready to be destroyed at a signal
. . . The man looked capable of such a thing. Destruction of water facilities
might well destroy Arrakis. That could well have been the club this Bewt held
over the Harkonnens.
"My Lord, the Duke, and I have other plans for our conservatory," Jessica
said. She smiled at Leto. "We intend to keep it, certainly, but only to hold it
in trust for the people of Arrakis. It is our dream that someday the climate of
Arrakis may be changed sufficiently to grow such plants anywhere in the open."
Bless her! Leto thought. Let our water-shipper chew on that.
"Your interest in water and weather control is obvious," the Duke said. "I'd
advise you to diversify your holdings. One day, water will not be a precious
commodity on Arrakis."
And he thought: Hawat must redouble his efforts at infiltrating this Bewt's
organization. And we must start on stand-by water facilities at once. No man is
going to hold a club over my head!
Bewt nodded, the smile still on his face. "A commendable dream, my Lord." He
withdrew a pace.
Leto's attention was caught by the expression on Kynes' face. The man was
staring at Jessica. He appeared transfigured--like a man in love . . . or caught
in a religious trance.
Kynes' thoughts were overwhelmed at last by the words of prophecy: "And they
shall share your most precious dream. "He spoke directly to Jessica: "Do you
bring the shortening of the way?"
"Ah, Dr. Kynes," the water-shipper said. "You've come in from tramping
around with your mobs of Fremen. How gracious of you."
Kynes passed an unreadable glance across Bewt, said: "It is said in the
desert that possession of water in great amount can inflict a man with fatal
carelessness."
"They have many strange sayings in the desert," Bewt said, but his voice
betrayed uneasiness.
Jessica crossed to Leto, slipped her hand under his arm to gain a moment in
which to calm herself. Kynes had said: " . . . the shortening of the way." In
the old tongue, the phrase translated as "Kwisatz Haderach." The planetologist's
odd question seemed to have gone unnoticed by the others, and now Kynes was
bending over one of the consort women, listening to a low-voiced coquetry.
Kwisatz Haderach, Jessica thought. Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that
legend here, too? The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul. He could be the
Kwisatz Haderach. He could be.
The Guild Bank representative had fallen into conversation with the watershipper, and Bewt's voice lifted above the renewed hum of conversations: "Many
people have sought to change Arrakis."
The Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the planetologist
upright and away from the flirting woman.
Into the sudden silence, a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared his
throat behind Leto, said: "Dinner is served, my Lord."
The Duke directed a questioning glance down at Jessica.
"The custom here is for host and hostess to follow their guests to table,"
She said, and smiled; "Shall we change that one, too, my Lord?"
He spoke coldly: "That seems a goodly custom. We shall let it stand for
now."
The illusion that I suspect her of treachery must be maintained, he thought.
He glanced at the guests filing past them. Who among you believes this lie?
Jessica, sensing his remoteness, wondered at it as she had done frequently
the past week. He acts like a man struggling with himself, she thought. Is it
because I moved so swiftly setting up this dinner party? Yet, he knows how
important it is that we begin to mix our officers and men with the locals on a
social plane. We are father and mother surrogate to them all. Nothing impresses
that fact more firmly than this sort of social sharing.
Leto, watching the guests file past, recalled what Thufir Hawat had said
when informed of the affair: "Sire! I forbid it!"
A grim smile touched the Duke's mouth. What a scene that had been. And when
the Duke had remained adamant about attending the dinner. Hawat had shaken his
head. "I have bad feelings about this, my Lord," he'd said. "Things move too
swiftly on Arrakis. That's not like the Harkonnens. Not like them at all."
Paul passed his father escorting a young woman half a head taller than
himself. He shot a sour glance at his father, nodded at something the young
woman said.
"Her father manufactures stillsuits," Jessica said. "I'm told that only a
fool would be caught in the deep desert wearing one of the man's suits."
"Who's the man with the scarred face ahead of Paul?" the Duke asked. "I
don't place him."
"A late addition to the list," she whispered. "Gurney arranged the
invitation. Smuggler."
"Gurney arranged?"
"At my request. It was cleared with Hawat, although I thought Hawat was a
little stiff about it. The smuggler's called Tuek, Esmar Tuek. He's a power
among his kind. They all know him here. He's dined at many of the houses."
"Why is he here?"
"Everyone here will ask that question," she said. "Tuek will sow doubt and
suspicion just by his presence. He'll also serve notice that you're prepared to
back up your orders against graft--by enforcement from the smugglers' end as
well. This was the point Hawat appeared to like."
"I'm not sure I like it." He nodded to a passing couple, saw only a few of
their guests remained to precede them. "Why didn't you invite some Fremen?"
"There's Kynes," she said.
"Yes, there's Kynes," he said. "Have you arranged any other little surprises
for me?" He led her into step behind the procession.
"All else is most conventional," she said.
And she thought: My darling, can't you see that this smuggler controls fast
ships, that he can be bribed? We must have a way out, a door of escape from
Arrakis if all else fails us here.
As they emerged into the dining hall, she disengaged her arm, allowed Leto
to seat her. He strode to his end of the table. A footman held his chair for
him. The others settled with a swishing of fabrics, a scraping of chairs, but
the Duke remained standing. He gave a hand signal, and the house troopers in
footman uniform around the table stepped back, standing at attention.
Uneasy silence settled over the room.
Jessica, looking down the length of the table, saw a faint trembling at the
corners of Leto's mouth, noted the dark flush of anger on his cheeks. What has
angered him? she asked herself. Surely not my invitation to the smuggler.
"Some question my changing of the laving basin custom," Leto said. "This is
my way of telling you that many things will change."
Embarrassed silence settled over the table.
They think him drunk, Jessica thought.
Leto lifted his water flagon, held it aloft where the suspensor, lights shot
beams of reflection off it. "As a Chevalier of the Imperium, then," he said, "I
give you a toast."
The others grasped their flagons, all eyes focused on the Duke. In the
sudden stillness, a suspensor light drifted slightly in an errant breeze from
the serving kitchen hallway. Shadows played across the Duke's hawk features.
"Here I am and here I remain!" he barked.
There was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouths--stopped as the Duke
remained with arm upraised. "My toast is one of those maxims so dear to our
hearts: 'Business makes progress! Fortune passes everywhere!' "
He sipped his water.
The others joined him. Questioning glances passed among them.
"Gurney!" the Duke called.
From an alcove at Leto's end of the room came Halleck's voice. "Here, my
Lord."
"Give us a tune, Gurney."
A minor chord from the baliset floated out of the alcove. Servants began
putting plates of food on the table at the Duke's gesture releasing them--roast
desert hare in sauce cepeda, aplomage sirian, chukka under glass, coffee with
melange (a rich cinnamon odor from the spice wafted across the table), a true
pot-a-oie served with sparkling Caladan wine.
Still, the Duke remained standing.

As the guests waited, their attention torn between the dishes placed before
them and the standing Duke, Leto said: "In olden times, it was the duty of the
host to entertain his guests with his own talents." His knuckles turned white,
so fiercely did he grip his water flagon. "I cannot sing, but I give you the
words of Gurney's song. Consider it another toast--a toast to all who've died
bringing us to this station."
An uncomfortable stirring sounded around the table.
Jessica lowered her gaze, glanced at the people seated nearest her--there
was the round-faced water-shipper and his woman, the pale and austere Guild Bank
representative (he seemed a whistle-faced scarecrow with his eyes fixed on
Leto), the rugged and scar-faced Tuck, his blue-within-blue eyes downcast.
"Review, friends--troops long past review," the Duke intoned. "All to fate a
weight of pains and dollars. Their spirits wear our silver collars. Review,
friends--troops long past review: Each a dot of time without pretense or guile.
With them passes the lure of fortune. Review, friends--troops long past review.
When our time ends on its rictus smile, we'll pass the lure of fortune."
The Duke allowed his voice to trail off on the last line, took a deep drink
from his water flagon, slammed it back onto the table. Water slopped over the
brim onto the linen.
The others drank in embarrassed silence.
Again, the Duke lifted his water flagon, and this time emptied its remaining
half onto the floor, knowing that the others around the table must do the same.
Jessica was first to follow his example.
There was a frozen moment before the others began emptying their flagons.
Jessica saw how Paul, seated near his father, was studying the reactions around
him. She found herself also fascinated by what her guests' actions revealed-especially among the women. This was clean, potable water, not something already
cast away in a sopping towel. Reluctance to just discard it exposed itself in
trembling hands, delayed reactions' nervous laughter . . . and violent obedience
to the necessity. One woman dropped her flagon, looked the other way as her male
companion recovered it.
Kynes, though, caught her attention most sharply. The planetotogist
hesitated, then emptied his flagon into a container beneath his jacket. He
smiled at Jessica as he caught her watching him, raised the empty flagon to her
in a silent toast. He appeared completely unembarrassed by his action.
Halleck's music still wafted over the room, but it had come out of its minor
key, lilting and lively now as though he were trying to lift the mood.
"Let the dinner commence," the Duke said, and sank into his chair.
He's angry and uncertain, Jessica thought. The loss of that factory crawler
hit him more deeply than it should have. It must be something more than that
loss. He acts like a desperate man. She lifted her fork, hoping in the motion to
hide her own sudden bitterness. Why not? He is desperate.
Slowly at first, then with increasing animation, the dinner got under way.
The stillsuit manufacturer complimented Jessica on her chef and wine.
"We brought both from Caladan," she said.
"Superb!" he said, tasting the chukka. "Simply superb! And not a hint of
melange in it. One gets so tired of the spice in everything."
The Guild Bank representative looked across at Kynes. "I understand, Doctor
Kynes, that another factory crawler has been lost to a worm."
"News' travels fast," the Duke said.
"Then it's true?" the banker asked, shifting his attention to Leto.
"Of course, it's true!" the Duke snapped. "The blasted carry-all
disappeared. It shouldn't be possible for anything that big to disappear!"
"When the worm came, there was nothing to recover the crawler," Kynes said.
"It should not be possible!" the Duke repeated.
"No one saw the carryall leave?" the banker asked.

"Spotters customarily keep their eyes on the sand," Kynes said. "They're
primarily interested in wormsign. A carryall's complement usually is four men-two pilots and two journeymen attachers. If one--or even two of this crew were
in the pay of the Duke's foes--"
"Ah-h-h, I see," the banker said. "And you, as Judge of the Change, do you
challenge this?"
"I shall have to consider my position carefully," Kynes said, "and I
certainly will not discuss it at table." And he thought: That pale skeleton of a
man! He knows this is the kind of infraction I was instructed to ignore.
The banker smiled, returned his attention to his food.
Jessica sat remembering a lecture from her Bene Gesserit school days. The
subject had been espionage and counter-espionage. A plump, happy-faced Reverend
Mother had been the lecturer, her jolly voice contrasting weirdly with the
subject matter.
A thing to note about any espionage and/or counter-espionage school is the
similar basic reaction pattern of all its graduates. Any enclosed discipline
sets its stamp, its pattern, upon its students. That pattern is susceptible to
analysis and prediction.
"Now, motivational patterns are going to be similar among all espionage
agents. That is to say: there will be certain types of motivation that are
similar despite differing schools or opposed aims. You will study first how to
separate this element for your analysis--in the beginning, through interrogation
patterns that betray the inner orientation of the interrogators; secondly, by
close observation of language-thought orientation of those under analysis. You
will find it fairly simple to determine the root languages of your subjects, of
course, both through voice inflection and speech pattern."
Now, sitting at table with her son and her Duke and their guests, hearing
that Guild Bank representative, Jessica felt a chill of realization: the man was
a Harkonnen agent. He had the Giedi Prime speech pattern--subtly masked, but
exposed to her trained awareness as though he had announced himself.
Does this mean the Guild itself has taken sides against House Atreides? she
asked herself. The thought shocked her, and she masked her emotion by calling
for a new dish, all the while listening for the man to betray his purpose. He
will shift the conversation next to something seemingly innocent, but with
ominous overtones, she told herself. It's his pattern.
The banker swallowed, took a sip of wine, smiled at something said to him by
the woman on his right. He seemed to listen for a moment to a man down the table
who was explaining to the Duke that native Arrakeen plants had no thorns.
"I enjoy watching the flights of birds on Arrakis," the banker said,
directing his words at Jessica. "All of our birds, of course, are carrioneaters, and many exist without water, having become blood-drinkers."
The stillsuit manufacturer's daughter, seated between Paul and his father at
the other end of the table, twisted her pretty face into a frown, said: "Oh,
Soo-Soo, you say the most disgusting things."
The banker smiled. "They call me Soo-Soo because I'm financial adviser to
the Water Peddlers Union." And, as Jessica continued to look at him without
comment, he added: "Because of the water-sellers' cry--'Soo-Soo Sook!' " And he
imitated the call with such accuracy that many around the table laughed.
Jessica heard the boastful tone of voice, but noted most that the young
woman had spoken on cue--a set piece. She had produced the excuse for the banker
to say what he had said. She glanced at Lingar Bewt. The water magnate was
scowling, concentrating on his dinner. It came to Jessica that the banker had
said: "I, too, control that ultimate source of power on Arrakis--water."
Paul had marked the falseness in his dinner companion's voice, saw that his
mother was following the conversation with Bene Gesserit intensity. On impulse,
he decided to play the foil, draw the exchange out. He addressed himself to the
banker.

"Do you mean, sir, that these birds are cannibals?"
"That's an odd question, young Master," the banker said. "I merely said the
birds drink blood. It doesn't have to be the blood of their own kind, does it?"
"It was not an odd question," Paul said, and Jessica noted the brittle
riposte quality of her training exposed in his voice. "Most educated people know
that the worst potential competition for any young organism can come from its
own kind." He deliberately forked a bite of food from his companion's plate, ate
it. "They are eating from the same bowl. They have the same basic requirements."
The banker stiffened, scowled at the Duke.
"Do not make the error of considering my son a child," the Duke said. And he
smiled.
Jessica glanced around the table, noted that Bewt had brightened, that both
Kynes and the smuggler, Tuek, were grinning.
"It's a rule of ecology," Kynes said, "that the young Master appears to
understand quite well. The struggle between life elements is the struggle for
the free energy of a system. Blood's an efficient energy source."
The banker put down his fork, spoke in an angry voice: "It's said that the
Fremen scum drink the blood of their dead."
Kynes shook his head, spoke in a lecturing tone: "Not the blood, sir. But
all of a man's water, ultimately, belongs to his people--to his tribe. It's a
necessity when you live near the Great Flat. All water's precious there, and the
human body is composed of some seventy per cent water by weight. A dead man,
surely, no longer requires that water."
The banker put both hands against the table beside his plate, and Jessica
thought he was going to push himself back, leave in a rage.
Kynes looked at Jessica. "Forgive me, my Lady, for elaborating on such an
ugly subject at table, but you were being told falsehood and it needed
clarifying."
"You've associated so long with Fremen that you've lost all sensibilities,"
the banker rasped.
Kynes looked at him calmly, studied the pale, trembling face. "Are you
challenging me, sir?"
The banker froze. He swallowed, spoke stiffly: "Of course not. I'd not so
insult our host and hostess."
Jessica heard the fear in the man's voice, saw it in his face, in his
breathing, in the pulse of a vein at his temple. The man was terrified of Kynes!
"Our host and hostess are quite capable of deciding for themselves when
they've been insulted," Kynes said. "They're brave people who understand defense
of honor. We all may attest to their courage by the fact that they are here . .
. now . . . on Arrakis."
Jessica saw that Leto was enjoying this. Most of the others were not. People
all around the table sat poised for flight, hands out of sight under the table.
Two notable exceptions were Bewt, who was openly smiling at the banker's
discomfiture, and the smuggler, Tuek, who appeared to be watching Kynes for a
cue. Jessica saw that Paul was looking at Kynes in admiration.
"Well?" Kynes said.
"I meant no offense," the banker muttered. "If offense was taken, please
accept my apologies."
"Freely given, freely accepted," Kynes said. He smiled at Jessica, resumed
eating as though nothing had happened.
Jessica saw that the smuggler, too, had relaxed. She marked this: the man
had shown every aspect of an aide ready to leap to Kynes' assistance. There
existed an accord of some sort between Kynes and Tuek.
Leto toyed with a fork, looked speculatively at Kynes. The Geologist's
manner indicated a change in attitude toward the House of Atreides. Kynes had
seemed colder on their trip over the desert.

Jessica signaled for another course of food and drink. Servants appeared
with langues de lapins de garenne--red wine and a sauce of mushroom-yeast on the
side.
Slowly, the dinner conversation resumed, but Jessica heard the agitation in
it, the brittle quality, saw that the banker ate in sullen silence. Kynes would
have killed him without hesitating, she thought. And she realized that there was
an offhand attitude toward killing in Kynes' manner. He was a casual killer, and
she guessed that this was a Fremen quality.
Jessica turned to the stillsuit manufacturer on her left, said: "I find
myself continually amazed by the importance of water on Arrakis."
"Very important," he agreed. "What is this dish? It's delicious."
"Tongues of wild rabbit in a special sauce," she said. "A very old recipe."
"I must have that recipe," the man said.
She nodded. "I'll see that you get it."
Kynes looked at Jessica, said: "The newcomer to Arrakis frequently
underestimates the importance of water here. You are dealing, you see, with the
Law of the Minimum."
She heard the testing quality in his voice, said, "Growth is limited by that
necessity which is present in the least amount. And, naturally, the least
favorable condition controls the growth rate."
"It's rare to find members of a Great House aware of planetological
problems," Kynes said. "Water is the least favorable condition for life on
Arrakis. And remember that growth itself can produce unfavorable conditions
unless treated with extreme care."
Jessica sensed a hidden message in Kynes' words, but knew she was missing
it. "Growth," she said. "Do you mean Arrakis can have an orderly cycle of water
to sustain human life under more favorable conditions?"
"Impossible!" the water magnate barked.
Jessica turned her attention to Bewt. "Impossible?"
"Impossible on Arrakis," he said. "Don't listen to this dreamer. All the
laboratory evidence is against him."
Kynes looked at Bewt, and Jessica noted that the other conversations around
the table had stopped while people concentrated on this new interchange.
"Laboratory evidence tends to blind us to a very simple fact," Kynes said.
"That fact is this: we are dealing here with matters that originated and exist
out-of-doors where plants and animals carry on their normal existence."
"Normal!" Bewt snorted. "Nothing about Arrakis is normal!"
"Quite the contrary," Kynes said. "Certain harmonies could be set up here
along self-sustaining lines. You merely have to understand the limits of the
planet and the pressures upon it."
"It'll never be done," Bewt said.
The Duke came to a sudden realization, placing the point where Kynes'
attitude had changed--it had been when Jessica had spoken of holding the
conservatory plants in trust for Arrakis.
"What would it take to set up the self-sustaining system, Doctor Kynes?"
Leto asked.
"If we can get three per cent of the green plant element on Arrakis involved
in forming carbon compounds as foodstuffs, we've started the cyclic system,"
Kynes said.
"Water's the only problem?" the Duke asked. He sensed Kynes' excitement,
felt himself caught up in it.
"Water overshadows the other problems," Kynes said. "This planet has much
oxygen without its usual concomitants--widespread plant life and large sources
of free carbon dioxide from such phenomena as volcanoes. There are unusual
chemical interchanges over large surf ace areas here."
"Do you have pilot projects?" the Duke asked.

"We've had a long time in which to build up the Tansley Effect--small-unit
experiments on an amateur basis from which my science may now draw its working
facts." Kynes said.
"There isn't enough water," Bewt said. "There just isn't enough water."
"Master Bewt is an expert on water," Kynes said. He smiled, turned back to
his dinner.
The Duke gestured sharply down with his right hand, barked: "No! I want an
answer! Is there enough water, Doctor Kynes?"
Kynes stared at his plate.
Jessica watched the play of emotion on his face. He masks himself well, she
thought, but she had him registered now and read that he regretted his words.
"Is there enough water?" the Duke demanded.
"There . . . maybe," Kynes said.
He's faking uncertainty! Jessica thought.
With his deeper truthsense, Paul caught the underlying motive, had to use
every ounce of his training to mask his excitement. There is enough water! But
Kynes doesn't wish it to be known.
"Our planetologist has many interesting dreams," Bewt said. "He dreams with
the Fremen--of prophecies and messiahs."
Chuckles sounded at odd places around the table Jessica marked them--the
smuggler, the stillsuit manufacturer's daughter, Duncan Idaho, the woman with
the mysterious escort service.
Tensions are oddly distributed here tonight, Jessica thought. There's too
much going on of which I'm not aware. I'll have to develop new information
sources.
The Duke passed his gaze from Kynes to Bewt to Jessica. He felt oddly let
down, as though something vital had passed him here. "May be," he muttered.
Kynes spoke quickly: "Perhaps we should discuss this another time, my Lord.
There are so many--"
The planetologist broke off as an uniformed Atreides trooper hurried in
through the service door, was passed by the guard and rushed to the Duke's side.
The man bent, whispering into Leto's ear.
Jessica recognized the capsign of Hawat's corps, fought down uneasiness. She
addressed herself to the stillsuit manufacturer's feminine companion--a tiny,
dark-haired woman with a doll face, a touch of epicanthic fold to the eyes.
"You've hardly touched your dinner, my dear," Jessica said. "May I order you
something?"
The woman looked at the stillsuit manufacturer before answering, then: "I'm
not very hungry."
Abruptly, the Duke stood up beside his trooper, spoke in a harsh tone of
command: "Stay seated, everyone. You will have to forgive me, but a matter has
arisen that requires my personal attention." He stepped aside. "Paul, take over
as host for me, if you please."
Paul stood, wanting to ask why his father had to leave, knowing he had to
play this with the grand manner. He moved around to his father's chair, sat down
in it.
The Duke turned to the alcove where Halleck sat, said: "Gurney, please take
Paul's place at table. We mustn't have an odd number here. When the dinner's
over, I may want you to bring Paul to the field C.P. Wait for my call."
Halleck emerged from the alcove in dress uniform, his lumpy ugliness seeming
out of place in the glittering finery. He leaned his baliset against the wall,
crossed to the chair Paul had occupied, sat down.
"There's no need for alarm," the Duke said, "but I must ask that no one
leave until our house guard says it's safe. You will be perfectly secure as long
as you remain here, and we'll have this little trouble cleared up very shortly."
Paul caught the code words in his father's message--guard-safe-secureshortly. The problem was security, not violence. He saw that his mother had read
the same message. They both relaxed.
The Duke gave a short nod, wheeled and strode through the service door
followed by his trooper.
Paul said: "Please go on with your dinner. I believe Doctor Kynes was
discussing water."
"May we discuss it another time?" Kynes asked.
"By all means," Paul said.
And Jessica noted with pride her son's dignity, the mature sense of
assurance.
The banker picked up his water flagon, gestured with it at Bewt. "None of us
here can surpass Master Lingar Bewt in flowery phrases. One might almost assume
he aspired to Great House status. Come, Master Bewt, lead us in a toast. Perhaps
you've a dollop of wisdom for the boy who must be treated like a man."
Jessica clenched her right hand into a fist beneath the table. She saw a
handsignal pass from Halleck to Idaho, saw the house troopers along the walls
move into positions of maximum guard.
Bewt cast a venomous glare at the banker.
Paul glanced at Halleck, took in the defensive positions of his guards,
looked at the banker until the man lowered the water flagon. He said: "Once, on
Caladan, I saw the body of a drowned fisherman recovered. He--"
"Drowned?" It was the stillsuit manufacturer's daughter.
Paul hesitated, then: "Yes. Immersed in water until dead. Drowned."
"What an interesting way to die," she murmured.
Paul's smile became brittle. He returned his attention to the banker. "The
interesting thing about this man was the wounds on his shoulders--made by
another fisherman's claw-boots. This fisherman was one of several in a boat--a
craft for traveling on water--that foundered . . . sank beneath the water.
Another fisherman helping recover the body said he'd seen marks like this man's
wounds several times. They meant another drowning fisherman had tried to stand
on this poor fellow's shoulders in the attempt to reach up to the surface--to
reach air."
"Why is this interesting?" the banker asked.
"Because of an observation made by my father at the time. He said the
drowning man who climbs on your shoulders to save himself is understandable-except when you see it happen in the drawing room." Paul hesitated just long
enough for the banker to see the point coming, then: "And, I should add, except
when you see it at the dinner table."
A sudden stillness enfolded the room.
That was rash, Jessica thought. This banker might have enough rank to call
my son out. She saw that Idaho was poised for instant action. The House troopers
were alert. Gurney Halleck had his eyes on the men opposite him.
"Ho-ho-ho-o-o-o!" It was the smuggler, Tuek, head thrown back laughing with
complete abandon.
Nervous smiles appeared around the table.
Bewt was grinning.
The banker had pushed his chair back, was glaring at Paul.
Kynes said: "One baits an Atreides at his own risk."
"Is it Atreides custom to insult their guests?" the banker demanded.
Before Paul could answer, Jessica leaned forward, said: "Sir!" And she
thought: We must learn this Harkonnen creature's game. Is he here to try for
Paul? Does he have help?
"My son displays a general garment and you claim it's cut to your fit?"
Jessica asked. "What a fascinating revelation." She slid a hand down to her leg
to the crysknife she had fastened in a calf-sheath.

The banker turned his glare on Jessica. Eyes shifted away from Paul and she
saw him ease himself back from the table, freeing himself for action. He had
focused on the code word: garment. "Prepare for violence. "
Kynes directed a speculative look at Jessica, gave a subtle hand signal to
Tuek.
The smuggler lurched to his feet, lifted his flagon. "I'll give you a
toast," he said. "To young Paul Atreides, still a lad by his looks, but a man by
his actions."
Why do they intrude? Jessica asked herself.
The banker stared now at Kynes, and Jessica saw terror return to the agent's
face.
People began responding all around the table.
Where Kynes leads, people follow, Jessica thought. He has told us he sides
with Paul. What's the secret of his power? It can't be because he's Judge of the
Change. That's temporary. And certainly not because he's a civil servant.
She removed her hand from the crysknife hilt, lifted her flagon to Kynes,
who responded in kind.
Only Paul and the banker-- (Soo-Soo! What an idiotic nickname! Jessica
thought.)--remained empty-handed. The banker's attention stayed fixed on Kynes.
Paul stared at his plate.
I was handling it correctly, Paul thought. Why do they interfere? He glanced
covertly at the male guests nearest him. Prepare for violence? From whom?
Certainly not from that banker fellow.
Halleck stirred, spoke as though to no one in particular, directing his
words over the heads of the guests across from him: "In our society, people
shouldn't be quick to take offense. It's frequently suicidal." He looked at the
stillsuit manufacturer's daughter beside him. "Don't you think so, miss?"
"Oh, yes. Yes. Indeed I do," She said. "There's too much violence. It makes
me sick. And lots of times no offense is meant, but people die anyway. It
doesn't make sense."
"Indeed it doesn't," Halleck said.
Jessica saw the near perfection of the girl's act, realized: That emptyheaded little female is not an empty-headed little female. She saw then the
pattern of the threat and understood that Halleck, too, had detected it. They
had planned to lure Paul with sex. Jessica relaxed. Her son had probably been
the first to see it--his training hadn't overlooked that obvious gambit.
Kynes spoke to the banker: "Isn't another apology in order?"
The banker turned a sickly grin toward Jessica, said: "My Lady, I fear I've
overindulged in your wines. You serve potent drink at table, and I'm not
accustomed to it."
Jessica heard the venom beneath his tone, spoke sweetly: "When strangers
meet, great allowance should be made for differences of custom and training."
"Thank you, my Lady," he said.
The dark-haired companion of the stillsuit manufacturer leaned toward
Jessica, said: "The Duke spoke of our being secure here. I do hope that doesn't
mean more fighting."
She was directed to lead the conversation this way, Jessica thought.
"Likely this will prove unimportant," Jessica said. "But there's so much
detail requiring the Duke's personal attention in these times. As long as enmity
continues between Atreides and Harkonnen we cannot be too careful. The Duke has
sworn kanly. He will leave no Harkonnen agent alive on Arrakis, of course." She
glanced at the Guild Bank agent. "And the Conventions, naturally, support him in
this." She shifted her attention to Kynes." Is this not so, Dr. Kynes?"
"Indeed it is," Kynes said.
The stillsuit manufacturer pulled his companion gently back. She looked at
him, said: "I do believe I'll eat something now. I'd like some of that bird dish
you served earlier."
Jessica signaled a servant, turned to the banker: "And you, sir, were
speaking of birds earlier and of their habits. I find so many interesting things
about Arrakis. Tell me, where is the spice found? Do the hunters go deep into
the desert?"
"Oh, no, my Lady," he said. "Very little's known of the deep desert. And
almost nothing of the southern regions."
"There's a tale that a great Mother Lode of spice is to be found in the
southern reaches," Kynes said, "but I suspect it was an imaginative invention
made solely for purposes of a song. Some daring spice hunters do, on occasion,
penetrate into the edge of the central belt, but that's extremely dangerous-navigation is uncertain, storms are frequent. Casualties increase dramatically
the farther you operate from Shield Wall bases. It hasn't been found profitable
to venture too far south. Perhaps if we had a weather satellite . . ."
Bewt looked up, spoke around a mouthful of food: "It's said the Fremen
travel there, that they go anywhere and have hunted out soaks and sip-wells even
in the southern latitudes."
"Soaks and sip-wells?" Jessica asked.
Kynes spoke quickly: "Wild rumors, my Lady. These are known on other
planets, not on Arrakis. A soak is a place where water seeps to the surface or
near enough to the surface to be found by digging according to certain signs. A
sip-well is a form of soak where a person draws water through a straw . . . so
it is said."
There's deception in his words, Jessica thought.
Why is he lying? Paul wondered.
"How very interesting," Jessica said. And she thought. "It is said . . ."
What a curious speech mannerism they have here. If they only knew what it
reveals about their dependence on superstitions.
"I've heard you have a saying," Paul said, "that polish comes from the
cities, wisdom from the desert."
"There are many sayings on Arrakis," Kynes said.
Before Jessica could frame a new question, a servant bent over her with a
note. She opened it, saw the Duke's handwriting and code signs, scanned it.
"You'll all be delighted to know," she said, "that our Duke sends his
reassurances. The matter which called him away has been settled. The missing
carryall has been found. A Harkonnen agent in the crew overpowered the others
and flew the machine to a smugglers' base, hoping to sell it there. Both man and
machine were turned over to our forces." She nodded to Tuek.
The smuggler nodded back.
Jessica refolded the note, tucked it into her sleeve.
"I'm glad it didn't come to open battle," the banker said. "The people have
such hopes the Atreides will bring peace and prosperity."
"Especially prosperity," Bewt said.
"Shall we have our dessert now?" Jessica asked. "I've had our chef prepare a
Caladan sweet: pongi rice in sauce dolsa."
"It sounds wonderful," the stillsuit manufacturer said. "Would it be
possible to get the recipe?"
"Any recipe you desire," Jessica said, registering the man for later mention
to Hawat. The stillsuit manufacturer was a fearful little climber and could be
bought.
Small talk resumed around her: "Such a lovely fabric . . ." "He is having a
setting made to match the jewel . . ." "We might try for a production increase
next quarter . . ."
Jessica stared down at her plate, thinking of the coded part of Leto's
message: "The Harkonnens tried to get in a shipment of lasguns. We captured
them. This may mean they've succeeded with other shipments. It certainly means
they don't place much store in shields. Take appropriate precautions."
Jessica focused her mind on lasguns, wondering. The white-hot beams of
disruptive light could cut through any known substance, provided that substance
was not shielded. The fact that feedback from a shield would explode both lasgun
and shield did not bother the Harkonnens. Why? A lasgun-shield explosion was a
dangerous variable, could be more powerful than atomics, could kill only the
gunner and his shielded target.
The unknowns here filled her with uneasiness.
Paul said: "I never doubted we'd find the carryall. Once my father moves to
solve a problem, he solves it. This is a fact the Harkonnens are beginning to
discover."
He's boasting, Jessica thought. He shouldn't boast. No person who'll be
sleeping far below ground level this night as a precaution against lasguns has
the right to boast.

-from "The Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
Jessica heard the disturbance in the great hall, turned on the light beside
her bed. The clock there had not been properly adjusted to local time, and she
had to subtract twenty-one minutes to determine that it was about 2 A.M.
The disturbance was loud and incoherent.
Is this the Harkonnen attack? she wondered.
She slipped out of bed, checked the screen monitors to see where her family
was. The screen showed Paul asleep in the deep cellar room they'd hastily
converted to a bedroom for him. The noise obviously wasn't penetrating to his
quarters. There was no one in the Duke's room, his bed was unrumpled. Was he
still at the field C.P.?
There were no screens yet to the front of the house.
Jessica stood in the middle of her room, listening.
There was one shouting, incoherent voice. She heard someone call for Dr.
Yueh. Jessica found a robe, pulled it over her shoulders, pushed her feet into
slippers, strapped the crysknife to her leg.
Again, a voice called out for Yueh.
Jessica belted the robe around her, stepped into the hallway. Then the
thought struck her: What if Leto's hurt?
The hall seemed to stretch out forever under her running feet. She turned
through the arch at the end, dashed past the dining hall and down the passage to
the Great Hall, finding the place brightly lighted, all the wall suspensors
glowing at maximum.
To her right near the front entry, she saw two house guards holding Duncan
Idaho between them. His head lolled forward, and there was an abrupt, panting
silence to the scene.
One of the house guards spoke accusingly to Idaho: "You see what you did?
You woke the Lady Jessica."
The great draperies billowed behind the men, showing that the front door
remained open. There was no sign of the Duke or Yueh. Mapes stood to one side
staring coldly at Idaho. She wore a long brown robe with serpentine design at
the hem. Her feet were pushed into unlaced desert boots.
"So I woke the Lady Jessica," Idaho muttered. He lifted his face toward the
ceiling, bellowed: "My sword was firs' blooded on Grumman!"
Great Mother! He's drunk! Jessica thought.
Idaho's dark, round face was drawn into a frown. His hair, curling like the
fur of a black goat, was plastered with dirt. A jagged rent in his tunic exposed
an expanse of the dress shirt he had worn at the dinner party earlier.
Jessica crossed to him.

One of the guards nodded to her without releasing his hold on Idaho. "We
didn't know what to do with him, my Lady. He was creating a disturbance out
front, refusing to come inside. We were afraid locals might come along and see
him. That wouldn't do at all. Give us a bad name here."
"Where has he been?" Jessica asked.
"He escorted one of the young ladies home from the dinner, my Lady. Hawat's
orders."
"Which young lady?"
"One of the escort wenches. You understand, my Lady?" He glanced at Mapes,
lowered his voice. "They're always calling on Idaho for special surveillance of
the ladies."
And Jessica thought: So they are. But why is he drunk?
She frowned, turned to Mapes. "Mapes, bring a stimulant. I'd suggest
caffeine. Perhaps there's some of the spice coffee left."
Mapes shrugged, headed for the kitchen. Her unlaced desert boots slapslapped against the stone floor.
Idaho swung his unsteady head around to peer at an angle toward Jessica.
"Killed more'n three hunner' men f'r the Duke," he muttered. "Whadduh wanna know
is why'm mere? Can't live unner th' groun' here. Can't live onna groun' here.
Wha' kinna place is 'iss, huh?"
A sound from the side hall entry caught Jessica's attention. She turned, saw
Yueh crossing to them, his medical kit swinging in his left hand. He was fully
dressed, looked pale, exhausted. The diamond tattoo stood out sharply on his
forehead.
"Th' good docker!" Idaho shouted. "Whad're you, Doc? Splint 'n' pill man?"
He turned blearily toward Jessica. "Makin' uh damn fool uh m'self, huh?"
Jessica frowned, remained silent, wondering: Why would Idaho get drunk? Was
he drugged?
"Too much spice beer," Idaho said, attempting to straighten.
Mapes returned with a steaming cup in her hands, stopped uncertainly behind
Yueh. She looked at Jessica, who shook her head.
Yueh put his kit on the floor, nodded greeting to Jessica, said: "Spice
beer, eh?"
"Bes' damn stuff ever tas'ed," Idaho said. He tried to pull himself to
attention. "My sword was firs' blooded on Grumman! Killed a Harkon . . . Harkon
. . . killed 'im f'r th' Duke."
Yueh turned, looked at the cup in Mapes' hand.
"What is that?"
"Caffeine," Jessica said.
Yueh took the cup, held it toward Idaho. "Drink this, lad."
"Don't wan' any more f drink."
"Drink it, I say!"
Idaho's head wobbled toward Yueh, and he stumbled one step ahead, dragging
the guards with him. "I'm almighdy fed up with pleasin' th' 'Mperial Universe,
Doc. Jus' once, we're gonna do th' thing my way."
"After you drink this," Yueh said. "It's just caffeine."
" 'Sprolly like all res' uh this place! Damn' sun 'stoo brighd. Nothin' has
uh righd color. Ever'thing's wrong or . . . "
"Well, it's nighttime now," Yueh said. He spoke reasonably. "Drink this like
a good lad. It'll make you feel better."
"Don' wanna feel bedder!"
"We can't argue with him all night," Jessica said. And she thought: This
calls for shock treatment.
"There's no reason for you to stay, my Lady," Yueh said. "I can take care of
this."
Jessica shook her head. She stepped forward, slapped Idaho sharply across
the cheek.

He stumbled back with his guards, glaring at her.
"This is no way to act in your Duke's home," she said. She snatched the cup
from Yueh's hands, spilling part of it, thrust the cup toward Idaho. "Now drink
this! That's an order!"
Idaho jerked himself upright, scowling down at her. He spoke slowly, with
careful and precise enunciation: "I do not take orders from a damn' Harkonnen
spy."
Yueh stiffened, whirled to face Jessica.
Her face had gone pale, but she was nodding. It all became clear to her--the
broken stems of meaning she had seen in words and actions around her these past
few days could now be translated. She found herself in the grip of anger almost
too great to contain. It took the most profound of her Bene Gesserit training to
quiet her pulse and smooth her breathing. Even then she could feel the blaze
flickering.
They were always calling on Idaho for surveillance of the ladies!
She shot a glance at Yueh. The doctor lowered his eyes.
"You knew this?" she demanded.
"I . . . heard rumors, my Lady. But I didn't want to add to your burdens."
"Hawat!" she snapped. "I want Thufir Hawat brought to me immediately!"
"But, my Lady . . . "
"Immediately!"
It has to be Hawat, she thought. Suspicion such as this could come from no
other source without being discarded immediately.
Idaho shook his head, mumbled. "Chuck th' whole damn thing."
Jessica looked down at the cup in her hand, abruptly dashed its contents
across Idaho's face. "Lock him in one of the guest rooms of the east wing," she
ordered. "Let him sleep it off."
The two guards stared at her unhappily. One ventured: "Perhaps we should
take him someplace else, m'Lady. We could . . . "
"He's supposed to be here!" Jessica snapped. "He has a job to do here." Her
voice dripped bitterness. "He's so good at watching the ladies."
The guard swallowed.
"Do you know where the Duke is?" she demanded.
"He's at the command post, my Lady."
"Is Hawat with him?"
"Hawat's in the city, my Lady."
"You will bring Hawat to me at once," Jessica said. "I will be in my sitting
room when he arrives."
"But, my Lady . . . "
"If necessary, I will call the Duke," she said. "I hope it will not be
necessary. I would not want to disturb him with this."
"Yes, my Lady."
Jessica thrust the empty cup into Mapes' hands, met the questioning stare of
the blue-within-blue eyes. "You may return to bed, Mapes."
"You're sure you'll not need me?"
Jessica smiled grimly. "I'm sure."
"Perhaps this could wait until tomorrow," Yueh said. "I could give you a
sedative and . . . "
"You will return to your quarters and leave me to handle this my way," she
said. She patted his arm to take the sting out of her command. "This is the only
way."
Abruptly, head high, she turned and stalked off through the house to her
rooms. Cold walls . . . passages . . . a familiar door . . . She jerked the door
open, strode in, and slammed it behind her. Jessica stood there glaring at the
shield-blanked windows of her sitting room. Hawat! Could he be the one the
Harkonnens bought? We shall see.

Jessica crossed to the deep, old-fashioned armchair with an embroidered
cover of schlag skin, moved the chair into position to command the door. She was
suddenly very conscious of the crysknife in its sheath on her leg. She removed
the sheath and strapped it to her arm, tested the drop of it. Once more, she
glanced around the room, placing everything precisely in her mind against any
emergency: the chaise near the corner, the straight chairs along the wall, the
two low tables, her stand-mounted zither beside the door to her bedroom.
Pale rose light glowed from the suspensor lamps. She dimmed them, sat down
in the armchair, patting the upholstery, appreciating the chair's regal
heaviness for this occasion.
Now, let him come, she thought. We shall see what we shall see. And she
prepared herself in the Bene Gesserit fashion for the wait, accumulating
patience, saving her strength.
Sooner than she had expected, a rap sounded at the door and Hawat entered at
her command.
She watched him without moving from the chair, seeing the crackling sense of
drug-induced energy in his movements, seeing the fatigue beneath. Hawat's rheumy
old eyes glittered. His leathery skin appeared faintly yellow in the room's
light, and there was a wide, wet stain on the sleeve of his knife arm.
She smelled blood there.
Jessica gestured to one of the straight-backed chairs, said: "Bring that
chair and sit facing me."
Hawat bowed, obeyed. That drunken fool of an Idaho! he thought. He studied
Jessica's face, wondering how he could save this situation.
"It's long past time to clear the air between us," Jessica said.
"What troubles my Lady?" He sat down, placed hands on knees.
"Don't play coy with me!" she snapped. "If Yueh didn't tell you why I
summoned you, then one of your spies in my household did. Shall we be at least
that honest with each other?"
"As you wish, my Lady."
"First, you will answer me one question," she said. "Are you now a Harkonnen
agent?"
Hawat surged half out of his chair, his face dark with fury, demanding: "You
dare insult me so?"
"Sit down," she said. "You insulted me so."
Slowly, he sank back into the chair.
And Jessica, reading the signs of this face that she knew so well, allowed
herself a deep breath. It isn't Hawat.
"Now I know you remain loyal to my Duke," she said. "I'm prepared,
therefore, to forgive your affront to me."
"Is there something to forgive?"
Jessica scowled, wondering: Shall I play my trump? Shall I tell him of the
Duke's daughter I've carried within me these few weeks? No . . . Leto himself
doesn't know. This would only complicate his life, divert him in a time when he
must concentrate on our survival. There is yet time to use this.
"A Truthsayer would solve this," she said, "but we have no Truthsayer
qualified by the High Board."
"As you say. We've no Truthsayer."
"Is there a traitor among us?" she asked. "I've studied our people with
great care. Who could it be? Not Gurney. Certainly not Duncan. Their lieutenants
are not strategically enough placed to consider. It's not you, Thufir. It cannot
be Paul. I know it's not me. Dr. Yueh, then? Shall I call him in and put him to
the test?"
"You know that's an empty gesture," Hawat said. "He's conditioned by the
High College. That I know for certain."
"Not to mention that his wife was a Bene Gesserit slain by the Harkonnens,"
Jessica said.

"So that's what happened to her," Hawat said.
"Haven't you heard the hate in his voice when he speaks the Harkonnen name?"
"You know I don't have the ear," Hawat said.
"What brought this base suspicion on me?" she asked.
Hawat frowned. "My Lady puts her servant in an impossible position. My first
loyalty is to the Duke."
"I'm prepared to forgive much because of that loyalty," she said.
"And again I must ask: Is there something to forgive?"
"Stalemate?" she asked.
He shrugged.
"Let us discuss something else for a minute, then," she said. "Duncan Idaho,
the admirable fighting man whose abilities at guarding and surveillance are so
esteemed. Tonight, he overindulged in something called spice beer. I hear
reports that others among our people have been stupefied by this concoction. Is
that true?"
"You have your reports, my Lady."
"So I do. Don't you see this drinking as a symptom, Thufir?"
"My Lady speaks riddles."
"Apply your Mentat abilities to it!" she snapped. "What's the problem with
Duncan and the others? I can tell you in four words--they have no home."
He jabbed a finger at the floor. "Arrakis, that's their home."
"Arrakis is an unknown! Caladan was their home, but we've uprooted them.
They have no home. And they fear the Duke's failing them."
He stiffened. "Such talk from one of the men would be cause for--"
"Oh, stop that, Thufir. Is it defeatist or treacherous for a doctor to
diagnose a disease correctly? My only intention is to cure the disease."
"The Duke gives me charge over such matters."
"But you understand I have a certain natural concern over the progress of
this disease," she said. "And perhaps you'll grant I have certain abilities
along these lines."
Will I have to shock him severely? she wondered. He needs shaking up-something to break him from routine.
"There could be many interpretations for your concern," Hawat said. He
shrugged.
"Then you've already convicted me?"
"Of course not, my Lady. But I cannot afford to take any chances, the
situation being what it is."
"A threat to my son got past you right here in this house," she said. "Who
took that chance?"
His face darkened. "I offered my resignation to the Duke."
"Did you offer your resignation to me . . . or to Paul?"
Now he was openly angry, betraying it in quickness of breathing, in dilation
of nostrils, a steady stare. She saw a pulse beating at his temple.
"I'm the Duke's man," he said, biting off the words.
"There is no traitor," she said. "The threat's something else. Perhaps it
has to do with the lasguns. Perhaps they'll risk secreting a few lasguns with
timing mechanisms aimed at house shields. Perhaps they'll . . . "
"And who could tell after the blast if the explosion wasn't atomic?" he
asked. "No, my Lady. They'll not risk anything that illegal. Radiation lingers.
The evidence is hard to erase. No. They'll observe most of the forms. It has to
be a traitor."
"You're the Duke's man," she sneered. "Would you destroy him in the effort
to save him?"
He took a deep breath, then: "If you're innocent, you'll have my most abject
apologies."
"Look at you now, Thufir," she said. "Humans live best when each has his own
place, when each knows where he belongs in the scheme of things. Destroy the
place and destroy the person. You and I, Thufir, of all those who love the Duke,
are most ideally situated to destroy the other's place. Could I not whisper
suspicions about you into the Duke's ear at night? When would he be most
susceptible to such whispering, Thufir? Must I draw it for you more clearly?"
"You threaten me?" he growled.
"Indeed not. I merely point out to you that someone is attacking us through
the basic arrangement of our lives. It's clever, diabolical. I propose to negate
this attack by so ordering our lives that there'll be no chinks for such barbs
to enter."
"You accuse me of whispering baseless suspicions?"
"Baseless, yes."
"You'd meet this with your own whispers?"
"Your life is compounded of whispers, not mine, Thufir."
"Then you question my abilities?"
She sighed. "Thufir, I want you to examine your own emotional involvement in
this. The natural human's an animal without logic. Your projections of logic
onto all affairs is unnatural, but suffered to continue for its usefulness.
You're the embodiment of logic--a Mentat. Yet, your problem solutions are
concepts that, in a very real sense, are projected outside yourself, there to be
studied and rolled around, examined from all sides."
"You think now to teach me my trade?" he asked, and he did not try to hide
the disdain in his voice.
"Anything outside yourself, this you can see and apply your logic to it,"
she said. "But it's a human trait that when we encounter personal problems,
those things most deeply personal are the most difficult to bring out for our
logic to scan. We tend to flounder around, blaming everything but the actual,
deep-seated thing that's really chewing on us."
"You're deliberately attempting to undermine my faith in my abilities as a
Mentat," he rasped. "Were I to find one of our people attempting thus to
sabotage any other weapon in our arsenal, I should not hesitate to denounce and
destroy him."
"The finest Mentats have a healthy respect for the error factor in their
computations," she said.
"I've never said otherwise!"
"Then apply yourself to these symptoms we've both seen: drunkenness among
the men, quarrels--they gossip and exchange wild rumors about Arrakis; they
ignore the most simple--"
"Idleness, no more," he said. "Don't try to divert my attention by trying to
make a simple matter appear mysterious."
She stared at him, thinking of the Duke's men rubbing their woes together in
the barracks until you could almost smell the charge there, like burnt
insulation. They're becoming like the men of the pre-Guild legend, she thought:
Like the men of the lost star-searcher, Ampoliros--sick at their guns--forever
seeking, forever prepared and forever unready.
"Why have you never made full use of my abilities in your service to the
Duke?" she asked. "Do you fear a rival for your position?"
He glared at her, the old eyes blazing. "I know some of the training they
give you Bene Gesserit . . . " He broke off, scowling.
"Go ahead, say it," she said. "Bene Gesserit witches."
"I know something of the real training they give you," he said. "I've seen
it come out in Paul. I'm not fooled by what your schools tell the public: you
exist only to serve."
The shock must be severe and he's almost ready for it, she thought.
"You listen respectfully to me in Council," she said, "yet you seldom heed
my advice. Why?"
"I don't trust your Bene Gesserit motives," he said. "You may think you can
look through a man; you may think you can make a man do exactly what you--"
"You poor fool, Thufir!" she raged.
He scowled, pushing himself back in the chair.
"Whatever rumors you've heard about our schools," she said, "the truth is
far greater. If I wished to destroy the Duke . . . or you, or any other person
within my reach, you could not stop me."
And she thought: Why do I let pride drive such words out of me? This is not
the way I was trained. This is not how I must shock him.
Hawat slipped a hand beneath his tunic where he kept a tiny projector of
poison darts. She wears no shield, he thought. Is this just a brag she makes? I
could slay her now . . . but, ah-h-h-h, the consequences if I'm wrong.
Jessica saw the gesture toward his pocket, said: "Let us pray violence shall
never be necessary between us."
"A worthy prayer," he agreed.
"Meanwhile, the sickness spreads among us," she said. "I must ask you again:
Isn't it more reasonable to suppose the Harkonnens have planted this suspicion
to pit the two of us against each other?"
"We appear to've returned to stalemate," he said.
She sighed, thinking: He's almost ready for it.
"The Duke and I are father and mother surrogates to our people," she said.
"The position--"
"He hasn't married you," Hawat said.
She forced herself to calmness, thinking: A good riposte, that.
"But he'll not marry anyone else," she said. "Not as long as I live. And we
are surrogates, as I've said. To break up this natural order in our affairs, to
disturb, disrupt, and confuse us--which target offers itself most enticingly to
the Harkonnens?"
He sensed the direction she was taking, and his brows drew down in a
lowering scowl.
"The Duke?" she asked. "Attractive target, yes, but no one with the possible
exception of Paul is better guarded. Me? I tempt them, surely, but they must
know the Bene Gesserit make difficult targets. And there's a better target, one
whose duties create, necessarily, a monstrous blind spot. One to whom suspicion
is as natural as breathing. One who builds his entire life on innuendo and
mystery." She darted her right hand toward him. "You!"
Hawat started to leap from his chair.
"I have not dismissed you, Thufir!" she flared.
The old Mentat almost fell back into the chair, so quickly did his muscles
betray him.
She smiled without mirth.
"Now you know something of the real training they give us," she said.
Hawat tried to swallow in a dry throat. Her command had been regal,
preemptory--uttered in a tone and manner he had found completely irresistible.
His body had obeyed her before he could think about it. Nothing could have
prevented his response--not logic, not passionate anger . . . nothing. To do
what she had done spoke of a sensitive, intimate knowledge of the person thus
commanded, a depth of control he had not dreamed possible.
"I have said to you before that we should understand each other," she said.
"I meant you should understand me. I already understand you. And I tell you now
that your loyalty to the Duke is all that guarantees your safety with me."
He stared at her, wet his lips with his tongue.
"If I desired a puppet, the Duke would marry me," she said. "He might even
think he did it of his own free will."
Hawat lowered his head, looked upward through his sparse lashes. Only the
most rigid control kept him from calling the guard. Control . . . and the
suspicion now that woman might not permit it. His skin crawled with the memory
of how she had controlled him. In the moment of hesitation, she could have drawn
a weapon and killed him!

Does every human have this blind spot? he wondered. Can any of us be ordered
into action before he can resist? The idea staggered him. Who could stop a
person with such power?
"You've glimpsed the fist within the Bene Gesserit glove," she said. "Few
glimpse it and live. And what I did was a relatively simple thing for us. You've
not seen my entire arsenal. Think on that,"
"Why aren't you out destroying the Duke's enemies?" he asked.
"What would you have me destroy?" she asked. "Would you have me make a
weakling of our Duke, have him forever leaning on me?"
"But, with such power . . . "
"Power's a two-edged sword, Thufir," she said; "You think: 'How easy for her
to shape a human tool to thrust into an enemy's vitals.' True, Thufir; even into
your vitals. Yet, what would I accomplish? If enough of us Bene Gesserit did
this, wouldn't it make all Bene Gesserit suspect? We don't want that, Thufir. We
do not wish to destroy ourselves." She nodded. "We truly exist only to serve."
"I cannot answer you," he said. "You know I cannot answer."
"You'll say nothing about what has happened here to anyone," she said. "I
know you, Thufir."
"My Lady . . . " Again the old man tried to swallow in a dry throat.
And he thought: She has great powers, yes. But would these not make her an
even more formidable tool for the Harkonnens?
"The Duke could be destroyed as quickly by his friends as by his enemies,"
she said. "I trust now you'll get to the bottom of this suspicion and remove
it."
"If it proves baseless," he said.
"If," she sneered.
"If," he said.
"You are tenacious," she said.
"Cautious," he said, "and aware of the error factor."
"Then I'll pose another question for you: What does it mean to you that you
stand before another human, that you are bound and helpless and the other human
holds a knife at your throat--yet this other human refrains from killing you,
frees you from your bonds and gives you the knife to use as you will?"
She lifted herself out of the chair, turned her back on him. "You may go
now, Thufir."
The old Mentat arose, hesitated, hand creeping toward the deadly weapon
beneath his tunic. He was reminded of the bull ring and of the Duke's father
(who'd been brave, no matter what his other failings) and one day of the corrida
long ago: The fierce black beast had stood there, head bowed, immobilized and
confused. The Old Duke had turned his back on the horns, cape thrown
flamboyantly over one arm, while cheers rained down from the stands.
I am the bull and she the matador, Hawat thought. He withdrew his hand from
the weapon, glanced at the sweat glistening in his empty palm.
And he knew that whatever the facts proved to be in the end, he would never
forget this moment nor lose this sense of supreme admiration for the Lady
Jessica.
Quietly, he turned and left the room.
Jessica lowered her gaze from the reflection in the windows, turned, and
stared at the closed door.
"Now we'll see some proper action," she whispered.

Irulan
Leto stood in the foyer of his house, studying a note by the light of a
single suspensor lamp. Dawn was yet a few hours away, and he felt his tiredness.
A Fremen messenger had brought the note to the outer guard just now as the Duke
arrived from his command post.
The note read: "A column of smoke by day, a pillar of fire by night."
There was no signature.
What does it mean? he wondered.
The messenger had gone without waiting for an answer and before he could be
questioned. He had slipped into the night like some smoky shadow.
Leto pushed the paper into a tunic pocket, thinking to show it to Hawat
later. He brushed a lock of hair from his forehead, took a sighing breath. The
anti-fatigue pills were beginning to wear thin. It had been a long two days
since the dinner party and longer than that since he had slept.
On top of all the military problems, there'd been the disquieting session
with Hawat, the report on his meeting with Jessica.
Should I waken Jessica? he wondered. There's no reason to play the secrecy
game with her any longer. Or is there?
Blast and damn that Duncan Idaho!
He shook his head. No, not Duncan. I was wrong not to take Jessica into my
confidence from the first. I must do it now, before more damage is done.
The decision made him feel better, and he hurried from the foyer through the
Great Hall and down the passages toward the family wing.
At the turn where the passages split to the service area, he paused. A
strange mewling came from somewhere down the service passage. Leto put his left
hand to the switch on his shield belt, slipped his kindjal into his right hand.
The knife conveyed a sense of reassurance. That strange sound had sent a chill
through him.
Softly, the Duke moved down the service passage, cursing the inadequate
illumination. The smallest of suspensors had been spaced about eight meters
apart along here and tuned to their dimmest level. The dark stone walls
swallowed the light.
A dull blob stretching across the floor appeared out of the gloom ahead.
Leto hesitated, almost activated his shield, but refrained because that
would limit his movements, his hearing . . . and because the captured shipment
of lasguns had left him filled with doubts.
Silently, he moved toward the grey blob, saw that it was a human figure, a
man face down on the stone. Leto turned him over with a foot, knife poised, bent
close in the dim light to see the face. It was the smuggler, Tuek, a wet stain
down his chest. The dead eyes stared with empty darkness. Leto touched the
stain--warm.
How could this man be dead here? Leto asked himself. Who killed him?
The mewling sound was louder here. It came from ahead and down the side
passage to the central room where they had installed the main shield generator
for the house.
Hand on belt switch, kindjal poised, the Duke skirted the body, slipped down
the passage and peered around the corner toward the shield generator room.
Another grey blob lay stretched on the floor a few paces away, and he saw at
once this was the source of the noise. The shape crawled toward him with painful
slowness, gasping, mumbling.
Leto stilled his sudden constriction of fear, darted down the passage,
crouched beside the crawling figure. It was Mapes, the Fremen housekeeper, her
hair tumbled around her face, clothing disarrayed. A dull shininess of dark
stain spread from her back along her side. He touched her shoulder and she
lifted herself on her elbows, head tipped up to peer at him, the eyes blackshadowed emptiness.
"S'you," she gasped. "Killed . . . guard . . . sent . . . get . . . Tuek . .
. escape . . . m'Lady . . . you . . . you . . . here . . . no . . . " She
flopped forward, her head thumping against the stone.
Leto felt for pulse at the temples. There was none. He looked at the stain:
she'd been stabbed in the back. Who? His mind raced. Did she mean someone had
killed a guard? And Tuek--had Jessica sent for him? Why?
He started to stand up. A sixth sense warned him. He flashed a hand toward
the shield switch--too late. A numbing shock slammed his arm aside. He felt pain
there, saw a dart protruding from the sleeve, sensed paralysis spreading from it
up his arm. It took an agonizing effort to lift his head and look down the
passage.
Yueh stood in the open door of the generator room. His face reflected yellow
from the light of a single, brighter suspensor above the door. There was
stillness from the room behind him--no sound of generators.
Yueh! Leto thought. He's sabotaged the house generators! We 're wide open!
Yueh began walking toward him, pocketing a dartgun.
Leto found he could still speak, gasped: "Yueh! How?" Then the paralysis
reached his legs and he slid to the floor with his back propped against the
stone wall.
Yueh's face carried a look of sadness as he bent over, touched Leto's
forehead. The Duke found he could feel the touch, but it was remote . . . dull.
"The drug on the dart is selective," Yueh said "You can speak, but I'd
advise against it." He glanced down the hall, and again bent over Leto, pulled
out the dart, tossed it aside. The sound of the dart clattering on the stones
was faint and distant to the Duke's ears.
It can't be Yueh, Leto thought. He's conditioned.
"How?" Leto whispered.
"I'm sorry, my dear Duke, but there are things which will make greater
demands than this." He touched the diamond tattoo on his forehead. "I find it
very strange, myself--an override on my pyretic conscience--but I wish to kill a
man. Yes, I actually wish it. I will stop at nothing to do it."
He looked down at the Duke. "Oh, not you, my dear Duke. The Baron Harkonnen.
I wish to kill the Baron."
"Bar . . . on Har . . . "
"Be quiet, please, my poor Duke. You haven't much time. That peg tooth I put
in your mouth after the tumble at Narcal--that tooth must be replaced, in a
moment, I'll render you unconscious and replace that tooth." He opened his hand,
stared at something in it. "An exact duplicate, its core shaped most exquisitely
like a nerve. It'll escape the usual detectors, even a fast scanning. But if you
bite down hard on it, the cover crushes. Then, when you expel your breath
sharply, you fill the air around you with a poison gas--most deadly."
Leto stared up at Yueh, seeing madness in the man's eyes, the perspiration
along brown and chin.
"You were dead anyway, my poor Duke," Yueh said. "But you will get close to
the Baron before you die. He'll believe you're stupefied by drugs beyond any
dying effort to attack him. And you will be drugged--and tied. But attack can
take strange forms. And you will remember the tooth. The tooth, Duke Leto
Atreides. You will remember the tooth."
The old doctor leaned closer and closer until his face and drooping mustache
dominated Leto's narrowing vision.
"The tooth," Yueh muttered.
"Why?" Leto whispered.

Yueh lowered himself to one knee beside the Duke. "I made a shaitan's
bargain with the Baron. And I must be certain he has fulfilled his half of it.
When I see him, I'll know. When I look at the Baron, then I will know. But I'll
never enter his presence without the price. You're the price, my poor Duke. And
I'll know when I see him. My poor Wanna taught me many things, and one is to see
certainty of truth when the stress is great. I cannot do it always, but when I
see the Baron--then, I will know."
Leto tried to look down at the tooth in Yueh's hand. He felt this was
happening in a nightmare--it could not be.
Yueh's purple lips turned up in a grimace. "I'll not get close enough to the
Baron, or I'd do this myself. No. I'll be detained at a safe distance. But you .
. . ah, now! You, my lovely weapon! He'll want you close to him--to gloat over
you, to boast a little."
Leto found himself almost hypnotized by a muscle on the left side of Yueh's
jaw. The muscle twisted when the man spoke.
Yueh leaned closer. "And you, my good Duke, my precious Duke, you must
remember this tooth." He held it up between thumb and forefinger. "It will be
all that remains to you."
Leto's mouth moved without sound, then: "Refuse."
"Ah-h, no! You mustn't refuse. Because, in return for this small service.
I'm doing a thing for you. I will save your son and your woman. No other can do
it. They can be removed to a place where no Harkonnen can reach them."
"How . . . save . . . them?" Leto whispered.
"By making it appear they're dead, by secreting them among people who draw
knife at hearing the Harkonnen name, who hate the Harkonnens so much they'll
burn a chair in which a Harkonnen has sat, salt the ground over which a
Harkonnen has walked." He touched Leto's jaw. "Can you feel anything in your
jaw?"
The Duke found that he could not answer. He sensed distant tugging, saw
Yueh's hand come up with the ducal signet ring.
"For Paul," Yueh said. "You'll be unconscious presently. Good-by, my poor
Duke. When next we meet we'll have no time for conversation."
Cool remoteness spread upward from Leto's jaw, across his cheeks. The
shadowy, hall narrowed to a pinpoint with Yueh's purple lips centered in it.
"Remember the tooth!" Yueh hissed. "The tooth!"

Jessica awoke in the dark, feeling premonition in the stillness around her.
She could not understand why her mind and body felt so sluggish. Skin raspings
of fear ran along her nerves. She thought of sitting up and turning on a light,
but something stayed the decision. Her mouth felt . . . strange.
Lump-lump-lump-lump!
It was a dull sound, directionless in the dark. Somewhere.
The waiting moment was packed with time, with rustling needle-stick
movements.
She began to feel her body, grew aware of bindings on wrists and ankles, a
gag in her mouth. She was on her side, hands tied behind her. She tested the
bindings, realized they were krimskell fiber, would only claw tighter as she
pulled.
And now, she remembered.
There had been movement in the darkness of her bedroom, something wet and
pungent slapped against her face, filling her mouth, hands grasping for her. She
had gasped--one indrawn breath--sensing the narcotic in the wetness.
Consciousness had receded, sinking her into a black bin of terror.
It has come, she thought. How simple it was to subdue the Bene Gesserit. All
it took was treachery. Hawat was right.
She forced herself not to pull on her bindings.
This is not my bedroom, she thought. They've taken me someplace else.
Slowly, she marshaled the inner calmness.
She grew aware of the smell of her own stale sweat with its chemical
infusion of fear.
Where is Paul? she asked herself. My son--what have they done to him?
Calmness.
She forced herself to it, using the ancient routines.
But terror remained so near.
Leto? Where are you, Leto?
She sensed a diminishing in the dark. It began with shadows. Dimensions
separated, became new thorns of awareness. White. A line under a door.
I'm on the floor.
People walking. She sensed it through the floor.
Jessica squeezed back the memory of terror. I must remain calm, alert, and
prepared. I may get only one chance. Again, she forced the inner calmness.
The ungainly thumping of her heartbeats evened, shaping out time. She
counted back. I was unconscious about an hour. She closed her eyes, focused her
awareness onto the approaching footsteps.
Four people.
She counted the differences in their steps.
I must pretend I'm still unconscious. She relaxed against the cold floor,
testing her body's readiness, heard a door open, sensed increased light through
her eyelids.
Feet approached: someone standing over her.
"You are awake," rumbled a basso voice. "Do not pretend."
She opened her eyes.
The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood over her. Around them, she recognized the
cellar room where Paul had slept, saw his cot at one side--empty. Suspensor
lamps were brought in by guards, distributed near the open door. There was a
glare of light in the hallway beyond that hurt her eyes.
She looked up at the Baron. He wore a yellow cape that bulged over his
portable suspensors. The fat cheeks were two cherubic mounds beneath spiderblack eyes.
"The drug was timed," he rumbled. "We knew to the minute when you'd be
coming out of it."
How could that be? she wondered. They 'd have to know my exact weight, my
metabolism, my . . . Yueh!
"Such a pity you must remain gagged," the Baron said. "We could have such an
interesting conversation."
Yueh's the only one it could be, she thought. How?
The Baron glanced behind him at the door. "Come in, Piter."
She had never before seen the man who entered to stand beside the Baron, but
the face was known--and the man: Piter de Vries, the Mentat-Assassin. She
studied him--hawk features, blue-ink eyes that suggested he was a native of
Arrakis, but subtleties of movement and stance told her he was not. And his
flesh was too well firmed with water. He was tall, though slender, and something
about him suggested effeminacy.
"Such a pity we cannot have our conversation, my dear Lady Jessica." the
Baron said. "However, I'm aware of your abilities." He glanced at the Mentat.
"Isn't that true, Piter?"
"As you say, Baron," the man said.

The voice was tenor. It touched her spine with a wash of coldness. She had
never heard such a chill voice. To one with the Bene Gesserit training, the
voice screamed: Killer!
"I have a surprise for Piter," the Baron said. "He thinks he has come here
to collect his reward--you, Lady Jessica. But I wish to demonstrate a thing:
that he does not really want you."
"You play with me, Baron?" Piter asked, and he smiled.
Seeing that smile, Jessica wondered that the Baron did not leap to defend
himself from this Piter. Then she corrected herself. The Baron could not read
that smile. He did not have the Training.
"In many ways, Piter is quite naive," the Baron said. "He doesn't admit to
himself what a deadly creature you are, Lady Jessica. I'd show him, but it'd be
a foolish risk." The Baron smiled at Piter, whose face had become a waiting
mask. "I know what Piter really wants. Piter wants power."
"You promised I could have her," Piter said. The tenor voice had lost some
of its cold reserve.
Jessica heard the clue-tones in the man's voice, allowed herself an inward
shudder. How could the Baron have made such an animal out of a Mentat?
"I give you a choice, Piter," the Baron said.
"What choice?"
The Baron snapped fat fingers. "This woman and exile from the Imperium, or
the Duchy of Atreides on Arrakis to rule as you see fit in my name."
Jessica watched the Baron's spider eyes study Piter.
"You could be Duke here in all but name," the Baron said.
Is my Leto dead, then? Jessica asked herself. She felt a silent wail begin
somewhere in her mind.
The Baron kept his attention on the Mentat. "Understand yourself, Piter. You
want her because she was a Duke's woman, a symbol of his power--beautiful,
useful, exquisitely trained for her role. But an entire duchy, Piter! That's
more than a symbol; that's the reality. With it you could have many women . . .
and more."
"You do not joke with Piter?"
The Baron turned with that dancing lightness the suspensors gave him. "Joke?
I? Remember--I am giving up the boy. You heard what the traitor said about the
lad's training. They are alike, this mother and son--deadly." The Baron smiled.
"I must go now. I will send in the guard I've reserved for this moment. He's
stone deaf. His orders will be to convey you on the first leg of your journey
into exile. He will subdue this woman if he sees her gain control of you. He'll
not permit you to untie her gag until you're off Arrakis. If you choose not to
leave . . . he has other orders."
"You don't have to leave," Piter said. "I've chosen."
"Ah, hah!" the Baron chortled. "Such quick decision can mean only one
thing."
"I will take the duchy," Piter said.
And Jessica thought: Doesn't Piter know the Baron's lying to him? But--how
could he know? He's a twisted Mentat.
The Baron glanced down at Jessica. "Is it not wonderful that I know Piter so
well? I wagered with my Master at Arms that this would be Piter's choice. Hah!
Well, I leave now. This is much better. Ah-h, much better. You understand, Lady
Jessica? I hold no rancor toward you. It's a necessity. Much better this way.
Yes. And I've not actually ordered you destroyed. When it's asked of me what
happened to you, I can shrug it off in all truth."
"You leave it to me then?" Piter asked.
"The guard I send you will take your orders," the Baron said. "Whatever's
done I leave to you." He stared at Piter. "Yes. There will be no blood on my
hands here. It's your decision. Yes. I know nothing of it. You will wait until
I've gone before doing whatever you must do. Yes. Well . . . ah, yes. Yes.
Good."
He fears the questioning of a Truthsayer, Jessica thought. Who? Ah-h-h, the
Reverend Mother Gaius Helen, of course! If he knows he must face her questions,
then the Emperor is in on this for sure. Ah-h-h-h, my poor Leto.
With one last glance at Jessica, the Baron turned, went out the door. She
followed him with her eyes, thinking: It's as the Reverend Mother warned--too
potent an adversary.
Two Harkonnen troopers entered. Another, his face a scarred mask, followed
and stood in the doorway with drawn lasgun.
The deaf one, Jessica thought, studying the scarred face. The Baron knows I
could use the Voice on any other man.
Scarface looked at Piter. "We've the boy on a litter outside. What are your
orders?"
Piter spoke to Jessica. "I'd thought of binding you by a threat held over
your son, but I begin to see that would not have worked, I let emotion cloud
reason. Bad policy for a Mentat." He looked at the first pair of troopers,
turning so the deaf one could read his lips: "Take them into the desert as the
traitor suggested for the boy. His plan is a good one. The worms will destroy
all evidence. Their bodies must never be found."
"You don't wish to dispatch them yourself?" Scarface asked.
He reads lips, Jessica thought.
"I follow my Baron's example," Piter said. "Take them where the traitor
said."
Jessica heard the harsh Mentat control in Piter's voice, thought: He, too,
fears the Truthsayer.
Piter shrugged, turned, and went through the doorway. He hesitated there,
and Jessica thought he might turn back for a last look at her, but he went out
without turning.
"Me, I wouldn't like the thought of facing that Truthsayer after this
night's work," Scarface said.
"You ain't likely ever to run into that old witch," one of the other
troopers said. He went around to Jessica's head, bent over her. "It ain't
getting our work done standing around here chattering. Take her feet and--"
"Why'n't we kill 'em here?" Scarface asked.
"Too messy," the first one said. "Unless you wants to strangle'em. Me, I
likes a nice straightforward job. Drop 'em on the desert like that traitor said,
cut 'em once or twice, leave 'the evidence for the worms. Nothing to clean up
afterwards."
"Yeah . . . well, I guess you're right," Scarface said.
Jessica listened to them, watching, registering. But the gag blocked her
Voice, and there was the deaf one to consider.
Scarface holstered his lasgun, took her feet. They lifted her like a sack of
grain, maneuvered her through the door and dumped her onto a suspensor-buoyed
litter with another bound figure. As they turned her, fitting her to the litter,
she saw her companion's face--Paul! He was bound, but not gagged. His face was
no more than ten centimeters from hers, eyes closed, his breathing even.
Is he drugged? she wondered.
The troopers lifted the litter, and Paul's eyes opened the smallest
fraction--dark slits staring at her.
He mustn't try the Voice! she prayed. The deaf guard!
Paul's eyes closed.
He had been practicing the awareness-breathing, calming his mind, listening
to their captors. The deaf one posed a problem, but Paul contained his despair.
The mind-calming Bene Gesserit regimen his mother had taught him kept him
poised, ready to expand any opportunity.

Paul allowed himself another slit-eyed inspection of his mother's face. She
appeared unharmed. Gagged, though.
He wondered who could've captured her. His own captivity was plain enough-to bed with a capsule prescribed by Yueh, awaking to find himself bound to this
litter. Perhaps a similar thing had befallen her. Logic said the traitor was
Yueh, but he held final decision in abeyance. There was no understanding it--a
Suk doctor a traitor.
The litter tipped slightly as the Harkonnen troopers maneuvered it through a
doorway into starlit night. A suspensor-buoy rasped against the doorway. Then
they were on sand, feet grating in it. A 'thopter wing loomed overhead, blotting
the stars. The litter settled to the ground.
Paul's eyes adjusted to the faint light. He recognized the deaf trooper as
the man who opened the 'thopter door, peered inside at the green gloom
illuminated by the instrument panel.
"This the 'thopter we're supposed to use?" he asked, and turned to watch his
companion's lips.
"It's the one the traitor said was fixed for desert work," the other said.
Scarface nodded. "But it's one of them little liaison jobs. Ain't room in
there for more'n them an' two of us."
"Two's enough," said the litter-bearer, moving up close and presenting his
lips for reading. "We can take care of it from here on, Kinet."
"The Baron he told me to make sure what happened to them two," Scarface
said.
"What you so worried about?" asked another trooper from behind the litterbearer.
"She is a Bene Gesserit witch," the deaf one said. "They have powers."
"Ah-h-h . . . "The litter-bearer made the sign of the fist at his ear. "One
of them, eh? Know whatcha mean."
The trooper behind him grunted. "She'll be worm meat soon enough. Don't
suppose even a Bene Gesserit witch has powers over one of them big worms. Eh,
Czigo?" He nudged the litter-bearer.
"Yee-up," the litter-bearer said. He returned to the litter, took Jessica's
shoulders. "C'mon, Kinet. You can go along if you wants to make sure what
happens."
"It is nice of you to invite me, Czigo," Scarface said.
Jessica felt herself lifted, the wing shadow spinning--stars. She was pushed
into the rear of the 'thopter, her krimskell fiber bindings examined, and she
was strapped down. Paul was jammed in beside her, strapped securely, and she
noted his bonds were simple rope.
Scarface, the deaf one they called Kinet, took his place in front. The
litter-bearer, the one they called Czigo, came around and took the other front
seat.
Kinet closed his door, bent to the controls. The 'thopter took off in a
wing-tucked surge, headed south over the Shield Wall. Czigo tapped his
companion's shoulder, said: "Whyn't you turn around and keep an eye on them
two?"
"Sure you know the way to go?" Kinet watched Czigo's lips.
"I listened to the traitor same's you."
Kinet swiveled his seat. Jessica saw the glint of starlight on a lasgun in
his hand. The 'thopter's light-walled interior seemed to collect illumination as
her eyes adjusted, but the guard's scarred face remained dim. Jessica tested her
seat belt, found it loose. She felt roughness in the strap against her left arm,
realized the strap had been almost severed, would snap at a sudden jerk.
Has someone been at this 'thopter, preparing it for us? she wondered. Who?
Slowly, she twisted her bound feet clear of Paul's.
"Sure do seem a shame to waste a good-looking woman like this," Scarface
said. "You ever have any highborn types?" He turned to look at the pilot.

"Bene Gesserit ain't all highborn," the pilot said.
"But they all looks heighty."
He can see me plain enough, Jessica thought. She brought her bound legs up
onto the seat, curled into a sinuous ball, staring at Scarface.
"Real pretty, she is," Kinet said. He wet his lips with his tongue. "Sure do
seem a shame." He looked at Czigo.
"You thinking what I think you're thinking?" the pilot asked.
"Who'd be to know?" the guard asked. "Afterwards . . . " He shrugged. "I
just never had me no highborns. Might never get a chance like this one again."
"You lay a hand on my mother . . . " Paul grated. He glared at Scarface.
"Hey!" the pilot laughed. "Cub's got a bark. Ain't got no bite, though."
And Jessica thought; Paul's pitching his voice too high. It may work,
though.
They flew on in silence.
These poor fools, Jessica thought, studying her guards and reviewing the
Baron's words. They'll be killed as soon as they report success on their
mission. The Baron wants no witnesses.
The 'thopter banked over the southern rim of the Shield Wall, and Jessica
saw a moonshadowed expanse of sand beneath them.
"This oughta be far enough," the pilot said. "The traitor said to put'em on
the sand anywhere near the Shield Wall." He dipped the craft toward the dunes in
a long, falling stoop, brought it up stiffly over the desert surface.
Jessica saw Paul begin taking the rhythmic breaths of the calming exercise.
He closed his eyes, opened them. Jessica stared, helpless to aid him. He hasn't
mastered the Voice yet, she thought, if he fails . . .
The 'thopter touched sand with a soft lurch, and Jessica, looking north back
across the Shield Wall, saw a shadow of wings settle out of sight up there.
Someone's following us! she thought. Who? Then: The ones the Baron set to
watch this pair. And there'll be watchers for the watchers, too.
Czigo shut off his wing rotors. Silence flooded in upon them.
Jessica turned her head. She could see out the window beyond Scarface a dim
glow of light from a rising moon, a frosted rim of rock rising from the desert.
Sandblast ridges streaked its sides.
Paul cleared his throat.
The pilot said: "Now, Kinet?"
"I dunno, Czigo."
Czigo turned, said: "Ah-h-h, look." He reached out for Jessica's skirt.
"Remove her gag," Paul commanded.
Jessica felt the words rolling in the air. The tone, the timbre excellent-imperative, very sharp. A slightly lower pitch would have been better, but it
could still fall within this man's spectrum.
Czigo shifted his hand up to the band around Jessica's mouth, slipped the
knot on the gag.
"Stop that!" Kinet ordered.
"Ah, shut your trap," Czigo said. "Her hands're tied." He freed the knot and
the binding dropped. His eyes glittered as he studied Jessica.
Kinet put a hand on the pilot's arm. "Look, Czigo, no need to . . . "
Jessica twisted her neck, spat out the gag. She pitched her voice in low,
intimate tones. "Gentlemen! No need to fight over me." At the same time, she
writhed sinuously for Kinet's benefit.
She saw them grow tense, knowing that in this instant they were convinced of
the need to fight over her. Their disagreement required no other reason. In
their minds, they were fighting over her.
She held her face high in the instrument glow to be sure Kinet would read
her lips, said: "You mustn't disagree." They drew farther apart, glanced warily
at each other. "Is any woman worth fighting over?" she asked.

By uttering the words, by being there, she made herself infinitely worth
their fighting.
Paul clamped his lips tightly closed, forced himself to be silent. There had
been the one chance for him to succeed with the Voice. Now--everything depended
on his mother whose experience went so far beyond his own.
"Yeah," Scarface said. "No need to fight over . . . "
His hand flashed toward the pilot's neck. The blow was met by a splash of
metal that caught the arm and in the same motion slammed into Kinet's chest.
Scarface groaned, sagged backward against his door.
"Thought I was some dummy didn't know that trick," Czigo said. He brought
back his hand, revealing the knife. It glittered in reflected moonlight.
"Now for the cub," he said and leaned toward Paul.
"No need for that," Jessica murmured.
Czigo hesitated.
"Wouldn't you rather have me cooperative?" Jessica asked. "Give the boy a
chance." Her lip curled in a sneer. "Little enough chance he'd have out there in
that sand. Give him that and . . . " She smiled. "You could find yourself well
rewarded."
Czigo glanced left, right, returned his attention to Jessica. "I've heard me
what can happen to a man in this desert," he said. "Boy might find the knife a
kindness."
"Is it so much I ask?" Jessica pleaded.
"You're trying to trick me," Czigo muttered.
"I don't want to see my son die," Jessica said. "Is that a trick?"
Czigo moved back, elbowed the door latch. He grabbed Paul, dragged him
across the seat, pushed him half out the door and held the knife posed. "What'll
y' do, cub, if I cut y'r bonds?"
"He'll leave here immediately and head for those rocks," Jessica said.
"Is that what y'll do, cub?" Czigo asked.
Paul's voice was properly surly. "Yes."
The knife moved down, slashed the bindings of his legs. Paul felt the hand
on his back to hurl him down onto the sand, feigned a lurch against the
doorframe for purchase, turned as though to catch himself, lashed out with his
right foot.
The toe was aimed with a precision that did credit to his long years of
training, as though all of that training focused on this instant. Almost every
muscle of his body cooperated in the placement of it. The tip struck the soft
part of Czigo's abdomen just below the sternum, slammed upward with terrible
force over the liver and through the diaphragm to crush the right ventricle of
the man's heart.
With one gurgling scream, the guard jerked backward across the seats. Paul,
unable to use his hands, continued his tumble onto the sand, landing with a roll
that took up the force and brought him back to his feet in one motion. He dove
back into the cabin, found the knife and held it in his teeth while his mother
sawed her bonds. She took the blade and freed his hands.
"I could've handled him," she said. "He'd have had to cut my bindings. That
was a foolish risk."
"I saw the opening and used it," he said.
She heard the harsh control in his voice, said: "Yueh's house sign is
scrawled on the ceiling of this cabin."
He looked up, saw the curling symbol.
"Get out and let us study this craft," she said. "There's a bundle under the
pilot's seat. I felt it when we got in."
"Bomb?"
"Doubt it. There's something peculiar here."
Paul leaped out to the sand and Jessica followed. She turned, reached under
the seat for the strange bundle, seeing Czigo's feet close to her face, feeling
dampness on the bundle as she removed it, realizing the dampness was the pilot's
blood.
Waste of moisture, she thought, knowing that this was Arrakeen thinking.
Paul stared around them, saw the rock scarp lifting out of the desert like a
beach rising from the sea, wind-carved palisades beyond. He turned back as his
mother lifted the bundle from the 'thopter, saw her stare across the dunes
toward the Shield Wall. He looked to see what drew her attention, saw another
'thopter swooping toward them, realized they'd not have time to clear the bodies
out of this 'thopter and escape.
"Run, Paul!" Jessica shouted. "It's Harkonnens!"

-from "Collected Sayings of, Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
A man in Harkonnen uniform skidded to a stop at the end of the hall, stared
in at Yueh, taking in at a single glance Mapes' body, the sprawled form of the
Duke, Yueh standing there. The man held a lasgun in his right hand. There was a
casual air of brutality about him, a sense of toughness and poise that sent a
shiver through Yueh.
Sardaukar, Yueh thought. A Bashar by the look of him. Probably one of the
Emperor's own sent here to keep an eye on things. No matter what the uniform,
there's no disguising them.
"You're Yueh," the man said. He looked speculatively at the Suk School ring
on the Doctor's hair, stared once at the diamond tattoo and then met Yueh's
eyes.
"I am Yueh," the Doctor said.
"You can relax, Yueh," the man said. "When you dropped the house shields we
came right in. Everything's under control here. Is this the Duke?"
"This is the Duke."
"Dead?"
"Merely unconscious. I suggest you tie him."
"Did you do for these others?" He glanced back down the hall where Mapes'
body lay.
"More's the pity," Yueh muttered.
"Pity!" the Sardaukar sneered. He advanced, looked down at Leto. "So that's
the great Red Duke."
If I had doubts about what this man is, that would end them, Yueh thought.
Only the Emperor calls the Atreides the Red Duke.
The Sardaukar reached down, cut the red hawk insignia from Leto's uniform.
"Little souvenir," he said. "Where's the ducal signet ring?"
"He doesn't have it on him," Yueh said.
"I can see that!" the Sardaukar snapped.
Yueh stiffened, swallowed, if they press me, bring in a Truthsayer, they'll
find out about the ring, about the 'thopter I prepared--all will fail.
"Sometimes the Duke sent the ring with a messenger as surety that an order
came directly from him," Yueh said.
"Must be damned trusted messengers," the Sardaukar muttered.
"Aren't you going to tie him?" Yueh ventured.
"How long'll he be unconscious?"
"Two hours or so. I wasn't as precise with his dosage as I was for the woman
and boy."
The Sardaukar spurned the Duke with his toe. "This was nothing to fear even
when awake. When will the woman and boy awaken?"
"About ten minutes."
"So soon?"
"I was told the Baron would arrive immediately behind his men."
"So he will. You'll wait outside, Yueh." He shot a hard glance at Yueh.
"Now!"
Yueh glanced at Leto. "What about . . . "
"He'll be delivered to the Baron all properly trussed like a roast for the
oven." Again, the Sardaukar looked at the diamond tattoo on Yueh's forehead.
"You're known; you'll be safe enough in the halls. We've no more time for chitchat, traitor. I hear the others coming."
Traitor, Yueh thought. He lowered his gaze, pressed past the Sardaukar,
knowing this as a foretaste of how history would remember him: Yueh the traitor.
He passed more bodies on his way to the front entrance and glanced at them,
fearful that one might be Paul or Jessica. All were house troopers or wore
Harkonnen uniform.
Harkonnen guards came alert, staring at him as he emerged from the front
entrance into flame-lighted night. The palms along the road had been fired to
illuminate the house. Black smoke from the flammables used to ignite the trees
poured upward through orange flames.
"It's the traitor," someone said.
"The Baron will want to see you soon," another said.
I must get to the 'thopter, Yueh thought. I must put the ducal signet where
Paul will find it. And fear struck him: If Idaho suspects me or grows impatient-if he doesn't wait and go exactly where I told him--Jessica and Paul will not
be saved from the carnage. I'll be denied even the smallest relief from my act.
The Harkonnen guard released his arm, said "Wait over there out of the way."
Abruptly, Yueh saw himself as cast away in this place of destruction, spared
nothing, given not the smallest pity. Idaho must not fail!
Another guard bumped into him, barked: "Stay out of the way, you!"
Even when they've profited by me they despise me. Yueh thought. He
straightened himself as he was pushed aside, regained some of his dignity.
"Wait for the Baron!" a guard officer snarled.
Yueh nodded, walked with controlled casualness along the front of the house,
turned the corner into shadows out of sight of the burning palms. Quickly, every
step betraying his anxiety, Yueh made for the rear yard beneath the conservatory
where the 'thopter waited--the craft they had placed there to carry away Paul
and his mother.
A guard stood at the open rear door of the house, his attention focused on
the lighted hall and men banging through there, searching from room to room.
How confident they were!
Yueh hugged the shadows, worked his way around the 'thopter, eased open the
door on the side away from the guard. He felt under the front seats for the
Fremkit he had hidden there, lifted a flap and slipped in the ducal signet. He
felt the crinkling of the spice paper there, the note he had written, pressed
the ring into the paper. He removed his hand, resealed the pack.
Softly, Yueh closed the 'thopter door, worked his way back to the corner of
the house and around toward the flaming trees.
Now, it is done, he thought.
Once more, he emerged into the light of the blazing palms. He pulled his
cloak around him, stared at the flames. Soon I will know. Soon I will see the
Baron and I will know. And the Baron--he will encounter a small tooth.

There is a legend that the instant the Duke Leto Atreides died a meteor streaked
across the skies above his ancestral palace on Caladan.
-the Princess Irulan: "Introduction to A Child's History of Muad'Dib"
The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood at a viewport of the grounded lighter he
was using as a command post. Out the port he saw the flame-lighted night of
Arrakeen. His attention focused on the distant Shield Wall where his secret
weapon was doing its work.
Explosive artillery.
The guns nibbled at the caves where the Duke's fighting men had retreated
for a last-ditch stand. Slowly measured bites of orange glare, showers of rock
and dust in the brief illumination--and the Duke's men were being sealed off to
die by starvation, caught like animals in their burrows.
The Baron could feel the distant chomping--a drumbeat carried to him through
the ship's metal: broomp . . . broomp. Then: BROOMP-broomp!
Who would think of reviving artillery in this day of shields? The thought
was a chuckle in his mind. But it was predictable the Duke's men would run for
those caves. And the Emperor will appreciate my cleverness in preserving the
lives of our mutual force.
He adjusted one of the little suspensors that guarded his fat body against
the pull of gravity. A smile creased his mouth, pulled at the lines of his
jowls.
A pity to waste such fighting men as the Duke's, he thought. He smiled more
broadly, laughing at himself. Pity should be cruel! He nodded. Failure was, by
definition, expendable. The whole universe sat there, open to the man who could
make the right decisions. The uncertain rabbits had to be exposed, made to run
for their burrows. Else how could you control them and breed them? He pictured
his fighting men as bees routing the rabbits. And he thought: The day hums
sweetly when you have enough bees working for you.
A door opened behind him. The Baron studied the reflection in the nightblackened viewport before turning.
Piter de Vries advanced into the chamber followed by Umman Kudu, the captain
of the Baron's personal guard. There was a motion of men just outside the door,
the mutton faces of his guard, their expressions carefully sheep-like in his
presence.
The Baron turned.
Piter touched finger to forelock in his mocking salute. "Good news, m'Lord.
The Sardaukar have brought in the Duke."
"Of course they have," the Baron rumbled.
He studied the somber mask of villainy on Piter's effeminate face. And the
eyes: those shaded slits of bluest blue-in-blue.
Soon I mast remove him, the Baron thought. He has almost outlasted his
usefulness, almost reached the point of positive danger to my person. First,
though, he must make the people of Arrakis hate him. Then--they will welcome my
darling Feyd-Rautha as a savior.
The Baron shifted his attention to the guard captain--Umman Kudu: scissorsline of jaw muscles, chin like a boot toe--a man to be trusted because the
captain's vices were known.
"First, where is the traitor who gave me the Duke?" the Baron asked. "I must
give the traitor his reward."
Piter turned on one toe, motioned to the guard outside.
A bit of black movement there and Yueh walked through. His motions were
stiff and stringy. The mustache drooped beside his purple lips. Only the old
eyes seemed alive. Yueh came to a stop three paces into the room, obeying a
motion from Piter, and stood there staring across the open space at the Baron.
"Ah-h-h, Dr. Yueh."
"M'Lord Harkonnen."
"You've given us the Duke, I hear."
"My half of the bargain, m'Lord."
The Baron looked at Piter.
Piter nodded.

The Baron looked back at Yueh. "The letter of the bargain, eh? And I . . ."
He spat the words out: "What was I to do in return?"
"You remember quite well, m'Lord Harkonnen."
And Yueh allowed himself to think now, hearing the loud silence of clocks in
his mind. He had seen the subtle betrayals in the Baron's manner. Wanna was
indeed dead--gone far beyond their reach. Otherwise, there'd still be a hold on
the weak doctor. The Baron's manner showed there was no hold; it was ended.
"Do I?" the Baron asked.
"You promised to deliver my Wanna from her agony."
The Baron nodded. "Oh, yes. Now, I remember. So I did. That was my promise.
That was how we bent the Imperial Conditioning. You couldn't endure seeing your
Bene Gesserit witch grovel in Piter's pain amplifiers. Well, the Baron Vladimir
Harkonnen always keeps his promises. I told you I'd free her from the agony and
permit you to join her. So be it." He waved a hand at Piter.
Piter's blue eyes took a glazed look. His movement was catlike in its sudden
fluidity. The knife in his hand glistened like a claw as it flashed into Yueh's
back.
The old man stiffened, never taking his attention from the Baron.
"So join her!" the Baron spat.
Yueh stood, swaying, His lips moved with careful precision, and his voice
came in oddly measured cadence: "You . . . think . . . you . . . de . . . feated
. . . me. You . . . think . . . I . . . did . . . not . . . know . . . what . .
. I . . . bought . . . for . . . my . . . Wanna."
He toppled. No bending or softening. It was like a tree falling.
"So join her," the Baron repeated. But his words were like a weak echo.
Yueh had filled him with a sense of foreboding. He whipped his attention to
Piter, watched the man wipe the blade on a scrap of cloth, watched the creamy
look of satisfaction in the blue eyes.
So that's how he kills by his own hand, the Baron thought. It's well to
know.
"He did give us the Duke?" the Baron asked.
"Of a certainty, my Lord," Piter said.
"Then get him in here!"
Piter glanced at the guard captain, who whirled to obey.
The Baron looked down at Yueh. From the way the man had fallen, you could
suspect oak in him instead of bones.
"I never could bring myself to trust a traitor," the Baron said. "Not even a
traitor I created."
He glanced at the night-shrouded viewport. That black bag of stillness out
there was his, the Baron knew. There was no more crump of artillery against the
Shield Wall caves; the burrow traps were sealed off. Quite suddenly, the Baron's
mind could conceive of nothing more beautiful than that utter emptiness of
black. Unless it were white on the black. Plated white on the black. Porcelain
white.
But there was still the feeling of doubt.
What had the old fool of a doctor meant? Of course, he'd probably known what
would happen to him in the end. But that bit about thinking he'd been defeated:
"You think you defeated me."
What had he meant?
The Duke Leto Atreides came through the door. His arms were bound in chains,
the eagle face streaked with dirt. His uniform was torn where someone had ripped
off his insignia. There were tatters at his waist where the shield belt had been
removed without first freeing the uniform ties. The Duke's eyes held a glazed,
insane look.
"Wel-l-l-l," the Baron said. He hesitated, drawing in a deep breath. He knew
he had spoken too loudly. This moment, long envisioned, had lost some of its
savor.

Damn that cursed doctor through all eternity!
"I believe the good Duke is drugged," Piter said. "That's how Yueh caught
him for us." Piter turned to the Duke. "Aren't you drugged, my dear Duke?"
The voice was far away. Leto could feel the chains, the ache of muscles, his
cracked lips, his burning cheeks, the dry taste of thirst whispering its grit in
his mouth. But sounds were dull, hidden by a cottony blanket. And he saw only
dim shapes through the blanket.
"What of the woman and the boy, Piter?" the Baron asked. "Any word yet?"
Piter's tongue darted over his lips.
"You've heard something!" the Baron snapped. "What?"
Piter glanced at the guard captain, back to the Baron. "The men who were
sent to do the job, m'Lord--they've . . . ah . . . been . . . ah . . . found."
"Well, they report everything satisfactory?"
"They're dead, m'Lord."
"Of course they are! What I want to know is--"
"They were dead when found, m'Lord."
The Baron's face went livid. "And the woman and boy?"
"No sign, m'Lord, but there was a worm. It came while the scene was being
investigated. Perhaps it's as we wished--an accident. Possibly--"
"We do not deal in possibilities, Piter. What of the missing 'thopter? Does
that suggest anything to my Mentat?"
"One of the Duke's men obviously escaped in it, m'Lord. Killed our pilot and
escaped."
"Which of the Duke's men?"
"It was a clean, silent killing, m'Lord. Hawat, perhaps, or that Halleck
one. Possibly Idaho. Or any top lieutenant."
"Possibilities," the Baron muttered. He glanced at the swaying, drugged
figure of the Duke.
"The situation is in hand, m'Lord," Piter said.
"No, it isn't! Where is that stupid planetologist? Where is this man Kynes?"
"We've word where to find him and he's been sent for, m'Lord."
"I don't like the way the Emperor's servant is helping us," the Baron
muttered.
They were words through a cottony blanket, but some of them burned in Leto's
mind. Woman and boy--no sign. Paul and Jessica had escaped. And the fate of
Hawat, Halleck, and Idaho remained an unknown. There was still hope.
"Where is the ducal signet ring?" the Baron demanded. "His finger is bare."
"The Sardaukar say it was not on him when he was taken, my Lord," the guard
captain said.
"You killed the doctor too soon," the Baron said. "That was a mistake. You
should've warned me, Piter. You moved too precipitately for the good of our
enterprise." He scowled. "Possibilities!"
The thought hung like a sine wave in Leto's mind: Paul and Jessica have
escaped! And there was something else in his memory: a bargain. He could almost
remember it.
The tooth!
He remembered part of it now: a pill of poison gas shaped into a false
tooth.
Someone had told him to remember the tooth. The tooth was in his mouth. He
could feel its shape with his tongue. All he had to do was bite sharply on it.
Not yet!
The someone had told him to wait until he was near the Baron. Who had told
him? He couldn't remember.
"How long will he remain drugged like this?" the Baron asked.
"Perhaps another hour, m'Lord."
"Perhaps," the Baron muttered. Again, he turned to the night-blackened
window. "I am hungry."
That's the Baron, that fuzzy gray shape there, Leto thought. The shape
danced back and forth, swaying with the movement of the room. And the room
expanded and contracted. It grew brighter and darker. It folded into blackness
and faded.
Time became a sequence of layers for the Duke. He drifted up through them. I
must wait.
There was a table. Leto saw the table quite clearly. And a gross, fat man on
the other side of the table, the remains of a meal in front of him. Leto felt
himself sitting in a chair across from the fat man, felt the chains, the straps
that held his tingling body in the chair. He was aware there had been a passage
of time, but its length escaped him.
"I believe he's coming around. Baron."
A silky voice, that one. That was Piter.
"So I see, Piter."
A rumbling basso: the Baron.
Leto sensed increasing definition in his surroundings. The chair beneath him
took on firmness, the bindings were sharper.
And he saw the Baron clearly now. Leto watched the movements of the man's
hands: compulsive touchings--the edge of a plate, the handle of a spoon, a
finger tracing the fold of a jowl.
Leto watched the moving hand, fascinated by it.
"You can hear me, Duke Leto," the Baron said. "I know you can hear me. We
want to know from you where to find your concubine and the child you sired on
her."
No sign escaped Leto, but the words were a wash of calmness through him.
It's true, then: they don't have Paul and Jessica.
"This is not a child's game we play," the Baron rumbled. "You must know
that." He leaned toward Leto, studying the face. It pained the Baron that this
could not be handled privately, just between the two of them. To have others see
royalty in such straits--it set a bad precedent.
Leto could feel strength returning. And now, the memory of the false tooth
stood out in his mind like a steeple in a flat landscape. The nerve-shaped
capsule within that tooth--the poison gas--he remembered who had put the deadly
weapon in his mouth.
Yueh.
Drug-fogged memory of seeing a limp corpse dragged past him in this room
hung like a vapor in Leto's mind. He knew it had been Yueh.
"Do you hear that noise, Duke Leto?" the Baron asked.
Leto grew conscious of a frog sound, the burred mewling of someone's agony.
"We caught one of your men disguised as a Fremen, " the Baron said. "We
penetrated the disguise quite easily: the eyes, you know. He insists he was sent
among the Fremen to spy on them. I've lived for a time on this planet, cher
cousin. One does not spy on those ragged scum of the desert. Tell me, did you
buy their help? Did you send your woman and son to them?"
Leto felt fear tighten his chest. If Yueh sent them to the desert fold . . .
the search won't stop until they 're found.
"Come, come," the Baron said. "We don't have much time and pain is quick.
Please don't bring it to this, my dear Duke." The Baron looked up at Piter who
stood at Leto's shoulder. "Piter doesn't have all his tools here, but I'm sure
he could improvise."
"Improvisation is sometimes the best, Baron."
That silky, insinuating voice! Leto heard it at his ear.
"You had an emergency plan," the Baron said. "Where have your woman and the
boy been sent?" He looked at Leto's hand. "Your ring is missing. Does the boy
have it?"
The Baron looked up, stared into Leto's eyes.

"You don't answer," he said. "Will you force me to do a thing I do not want
to do? Piter will use simple, direct methods. I agree they're sometimes the
best, but it's not good that you should be subjected to such things."
"Hot tallow on the back, perhaps, or on the eyelids," Piter said. "Perhaps
on other portions of the body. It's especially effective when the subject
doesn't know where the tallow will fall next. It's a good method and there's a
sort of beauty in the pattern of pus-white blisters on naked skin, eh, Baron?"
"Exquisite," the Baron said, and his voice sounded sour.
Those touching fingers! Leto watched the fat hands, the glittering jewels on
baby-fat hands--their compulsive wandering.
The sounds of agony coming through the door behind him gnawed at the Duke's
nerves. Who is it they caught? he wondered. Could it have been Idaho?
"Believe me, cher cousin," the Baron said. "I do not want it to come to
this."
"You think of nerve couriers racing to summon help that cannot come," Piter
said. "There's an artistry in this, you know."
"You're a superb artist," the Baron growled. "Now, have the decency to be
silent."
Leto suddenly recalled a thing Gurney Halleck had said once, seeing a
picture of the Baron: " 'And I stood upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast
rise up out of the sea . . . and upon his heads the name of blasphemy.' "
"We waste time, Baron," Piter said.
"Perhaps."
The Baron nodded. "You know, my dear Leto, you'll tell us in the end where
they are. There's a level of pain that'll buy you."
He's most likely correct, Leto thought. Were if not for the tooth . . . and
the fact that I truly don't know where they are.
The Baron picked up a sliver of meat, pressed the morsel into his mouth,
chewed slowly, swallowed. We must try a new tack, he thought.
"Observe this prize person who denies he's for hire," the Baron said.
"Observe him, Piter."
And the Baron thought: Yes! See him there, this man who believes he cannot
be bought. See him detained there by a million shares of himself sold in
dribbles every second of his life! If you took him up now and shook him, he'd
rattle inside. Emptied! Sold out! What difference how he dies now?
The frog sounds in the background stopped.
The Baron saw Umman Kudu, the guard captain, appear in the doorway across
the room, shake his head. The captive hadn't produced the needed information.
Another failure. Time to quit stalling with this fool Duke, this stupid soft
fool who didn't realize how much hell there was so near him--only a nerve's
thickness away.
This thought calmed the Baron, overcoming his reluctance to have a royal
person subject to pain. He saw himself suddenly as a surgeon exercising endless
supple scissor dissections--cutting away the masks from fools, exposing the hell
beneath.
Rabbits, all of them!
And how they cowered when they saw the carnivore!
Leto stared across the table, wondering why he waited. The tooth would end
it all quickly. Still--it had been good, much of this life. He found himself
remembering an antenna kite updangling in the shell-blue sky of Caladan, and
Paul laughing with joy at the sight of it. And he remembered sunrise here on
Arrakis--colored strata of the Shield Wall mellowed by dust haze.
"Too bad," the Baron muttered. He pushed himself back from the table, stood
up lightly in his suspensors and hesitated, seeing a change come over the Duke.
He saw the man draw in a deep breath, the jawline stiffen, the ripple of a
muscle there as the Duke clamped his mouth shut.
How he fears me! the Baron thought.

Shocked by fear that the Baron might escape him, Leto bit sharply on the
capsule tooth, felt it break. He opened his mouth, expelled the biting vapor he
could taste as it formed on his tongue. The Baron grew smaller, a figure seen in
a tightening tunnel. Leto heard a gasp beside his ear--the silky-voiced one:
Piter.
It got him, too!
"Piter! What's wrong?"
The rumbling voice was far away.
Leto sensed memories rolling in his mind--the old toothless mutterings of
hags. The room, the table, the Baron, a pair of terrified eyes--blue within
blue, the eyes--all compressed around him in ruined symmetry.
There was a man with a boot-toe chin, a toy man falling. The toy man had a
broken nose slanted to the left: an offbeat metronome caught forever at the
start of an upward stroke. Leto heard the crash of crockery--so distant--a
roaring in his ears. His mind was a bin without end, catching everything.
Everything that had ever been: every shout, every whisper, every . . . silence.
One thought remained to him. Leto saw it in formless light on rays of black:
The day the flesh shapes and the flesh the day shapes. The thought struck him
with a sense of fullness he knew he could never explain.
Silence.
The Baron stood with his back against his private door, his own bolt hole
behind the table. He had slammed it on a room full of dead men. His senses took
in guards swarming around him. Did I breathe it? he asked himself. Whatever it
was in there, did it get me, too?
Sounds returned to him . . . and reason. He heard someone shouting orders-gas masks . . . keep a door closed . . . get blowers going.
The others fell quickly, he thought. I'm still standing. I'm still
breathing. Merciless hell! That was close!
He could analyze it now. His shield had been activated, set low but still
enough to slow molecular interchange across the field barrier. And he had been
pushing himself away from the table . . . that and Piter's shocked gasp which
had brought the guard captain darting forward into his own doom.
Chance and the warning in a dying man's gasp--these had saved him.
The Baron felt no gratitude to Piter. The fool had got himself killed. And
that stupid guard captain! He'd said he scoped everyone before bringing them
into the Baron's presence! How had it been possible for the Duke . . . ? No
warning. Not even from the poison snooper over the table--until it was too late.
How?
Well, no matter now, the Baron thought, his mind firming. The next guard
captain will begin by finding answers to these questions.
He grew aware of more activity down the hall--around the corner at the other
door to that room of death. The Baron pushed himself away from his own door,
studied the lackeys around him. They stood there staring, silent, waiting for
the Baron's reaction.
Would the Baron be angry?
And the Baron realized only a few seconds had passed since his flight from
that terrible room.
Some of the guards had weapons leveled at the door. Some were directing
their ferocity toward the empty hall that stretched away toward the noises
around the corner to their right.
A man came striding around that corner, gas mask dangling by its straps at
his neck, his eyes intent on the overhead poison snoopers that lined this
corridor. He was yellow-haired, flat of face with green eyes. Crisp lines
radiated from his thick-lipped mouth. He looked like some water creature
misplaced among those who walked the land.
The Baron stared at the approaching man, recalling the name: Nefud. Iakin
Nefud. Guard corporal. Nefud was addicted to semuta, the drug-music combination
that played itself in the deepest consciousness. A useful item of information,
that.
The man stopped in front of the Baron, saluted. "Corridor's clear, m'Lord. I
was outside watching and saw that it must be poison gas. Ventilators in your
room were pulling air in from these corridors." He glanced up at the snooper
over the Baron's head. "None of the stuff escaped. We have the room cleaned out
now. What are your orders?"
The Baron recognized the man's voice--the one who'd been shouting orders.
Efficient, this corporal, he thought.
"They're all dead in there?" the Baron asked.
"Yes, m'Lord."
Well, we must adjust, the Baron thought.
"First," he said, "let me congratulate you, Nefud. You're the new captain of
my guard. And I hope you'll take to heart the lesson to be learned from the fate
of your predecessor."
The Baron watched the awareness grow in his newly promoted guardsman. Nefud
knew he'd never again be without his semuta.
Nefud nodded. "My Lord knows I'll devote myself entirely to his safety."
"Yes. Well, to business. I suspect the Duke had something in his mouth. You
will find out what that something was, how it was used, who helped him put it
there. You'll take every precaution--"
He broke off, his chain of thought shattered by a disturbance in the
corridor behind him--guards at the door to the lift from the lower levels of the
frigate trying to hold back a tall colonel bashar who had just emerged from the
lift.
The Baron couldn't place the colonel bashar's face: thin with mouth like a
slash in leather, twin ink spots for eyes.
"Get your hands off me, you pack of carrion-eaters!" the man roared, and he
dashed the guards aside.
Ah-h-h, one of the Sardaukar, the Baron thought.
The colonel bashar came striding toward the Baron, whose eyes went to slits
of apprehension. The Sardaukar officers filled him with unease. They all seemed
to look like relatives of the Duke . . . the late Duke. And their manners with
the Baron!
The colonel bashar planted himself half a pace in front of the Baron, hands
on hips. The guard hovered behind him in twitching uncertainty.
The Baron noted the absence of salute, the disdain in the Sardaukar's
manner, and his unease grew. There was only the one legion of them locally--ten
brigades--reinforcing the Harkonnen legions, but the Baron did not fool himself.
That one legion was perfectly capable of turning on the Harkonnens and
overcoming them.
"Tell your men they are not to prevent me from seeing you, Baron," the
Sardaukar growled. "My men brought you the Atreides Duke before I could discuss
his fate with you. We will discuss it now."
I must not lose face before my men, the Baron thought.
"So?" It was a coldly controlled word, and the Baron felt proud of it.
"My Emperor has charged me to make certain his royal cousin dies cleanly
without agony," the colonel bashar said.
"Such were the Imperial orders to me," the Baron lied. "Did you think I'd
disobey?"
"I'm to report to my Emperor what I see with my own eyes," the Sardaukar
said.
"The Duke's already dead," the Baron snapped, and he waved a hand to dismiss
the fellow.
The colonel bashar remained planted facing the Baron. Not by flicker of eye
or muscle did he acknowledge he had been dismissed. "How?" he growled.
Really! the Baron thought. This is too much.

"By his own hand, if you must know," the Baron said. "He took poison."
"I will see the body now," the colonel Bashar said.
The Baron raised his gaze to the ceiling in feigned exasperation while his
thoughts raced. Damnation! This sharp-eyed Sardaukar will see the room before a
thing's been changed!
"Now," the Sardaukar growled. "I'll see it with my own eyes."
There was no preventing it, the Baron realized. The Sardaukar would see all.
He'd know the Duke had killed Harkonnen men . . . that the Baron most likely had
escaped by a narrow margin. There was the evidence of the dinner remnants on the
table, and the dead Duke across from it with destruction around him.
No preventing it at all.
"I'll not be put off," the colonel bashar snarled.
"You're not being put off," the Baron said, and he stared into the
Sardaukar's obsidian eyes. "I hide nothing from my Emperor." He nodded to Nefud.
"The colonel bashar is to see everything, at once. Take him in by the door where
you stood, Nefud."
"This way, sir," Nefud said.
Slowly, insolently, the Sardaukar moved around the Baron, shouldered a way
through the guardsmen.
Insufferable, the Baron thought. Now, the Emperor will know how I slipped
up. He'll recognize it as a sign of weakness.
And it was agonizing to realize that the Emperor and his Sardaukar were
alike in their disdain for weakness. The Baron chewed at his lower lip,
consoling himself that the Emperor, at least, had not learned of the Atreides
raid on Giedi Prime, the destruction of the Harkonnen spice stores there.
Damn that slippery Duke!
The Baron watched the retreating backs--the arrogant Sardaukar and the
stocky, efficient Nefud.
We must adjust, the Baron thought. I'll have to put Rabban over this
damnable planet once more. Without restraint. I must spend my own Harkonnen
blood to put Arrakis into a proper condition for accepting Feyd-Rautha. Damn
that Piter! He would get himself killed before I was through with him.
The Baron sighed.
And I must send at once to Tleielax for a new Mentat. They undoubtedly have
the new one ready for me by now.
One of the guardsmen beside him coughed.
The Baron turned toward the man. "I am hungry."
"Yes, m'Lord."
"And I wish to be diverted while you're clearing out that room and studying
its secrets for me," the Baron rumbled.
The guardsman lowered his eyes. "What diversion does m'Lord wish?"
"I'll be in my sleeping chambers," the Baron said. "Bring me that young
fellow we bought on Gamont, the one with the lovely eyes. Drug him well. I don't
feel like wrestling."
"Yes, m'Lord."
The Baron turned away, began moving with his bouncing, suspensor-buoyed pace
toward his chambers. Yes, he thought. The one with the lovely eyes, the one who
looks so much like the young Paul Atreides.

O Seas of Caladan,
O people of Duke Leto-Citadel of Leto fallen,
Fallen forever . . .
-from "Songs of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
Paul felt that all his past, every experience before this night, had become
sand curling in an hourglass. He sat near his mother hugging his knees within a
small fabric and plastic hutment--a stilltent--that had come, like the Fremen
clothing they now wore, from the pack left in the 'thopter.
There was no doubt in Paul's mind who had put the Fremkit there, who had
directed the course of the 'thopter carrying them captive.
Yueh.
The traitor doctor had sent them directly into the hands of Duncan Idaho.
Paul stared out the transparent end of the stilltent at the moonshadowed
rocks that ringed this place where Idaho had hidden them.
Hiding like a child when I'm now the Duke, Paul thought. He felt the thought
gall him, but could not deny the wisdom in what they did.
Something had happened to his awareness this night--he saw with sharpened
clarity every circumstance and occurrence around him. He felt unable to stop the
inflow of data or the cold precision with which each new item was added to his
knowledge and the computation was centered in his awareness. It was Mentat power
and more.
Paul thought back to the moment of impotent rage as the strange 'thopter
dived out of the night onto them, stooping like a giant hawk above the desert
with wind screaming through its wings. The thing in Paul's mind had happened
then. The 'thopter had skidded and slewed across a sand ridge toward the running
figures--his mother and himself. Paul remembered how the smell of burned sulfur
from abrasion of 'thopter skids against sand had drifted across them.
His mother, he knew, had turned, expected to meet a lasgun in the hands of
Harkonnen mercenaries, and had recognized Duncan Idaho leaning out the
'thopter's open door shouting: "Hurry! There's wormsign south of you!"
But Paul had known as he turned who piloted the 'thopter. An accumulation of
minutiae in the way it was flown, the dash of the landing--clues so small even
his mother hadn't detected them--had told Paul precisely who sat at those
controls.
Across the stilltent from Paul, Jessica stirred, said: "There can be only
one explanation. The Harkonnens held Yueh's wife. He hated the Harkonnens! I
cannot be wrong about that. You read his note. But why has he saved us from the
carnage?"
She is only now seeing it and that poorly, Paul thought. The thought was a
shock. He had known this fact as a by-the-way thing while reading the note that
had accompanied the ducal signet in the pack.
"Do not try to forgive me," Yueh had written. "I do not want your
forgiveness. I already have enough burdens. What I have done was done without
malice or hope of another's understanding. It is my own tahaddi al-burhan, my
ultimate test. I give you the Atreides ducal signet as token that I write truly.
By the time you read this, Duke Leto will be dead. Take consolation from my
assurance that he did not die alone, that one we hate above all others died with
him."
It had not been addressed or signed, but there 'd been no mistaking the
familiar scrawl--Yueh's.
Remembering the letter, Paul re-experienced the distress of that moment--a
thing sharp and strange that seemed to happen outside his new mentat alertness.
He had read that his father was dead, known the truth of the words, but had felt
them as no more than another datum to be entered in his mind and used.
I loved my father, Paul thought, and knew this for truth. I should mourn
him. I should feel something.
But he felt nothing except: Here's an important fact.
It was one with all the other facts.
All the while his mind was adding sense impressions, extrapolating,
computing.

Halleck's words came back to Paul: "Mood's a thing for cattle or for making
love. You fight when the necessity arises, no matter your mood. "
Perhaps that's it, Paul thought. I'll mourn my father later . . . when
there's time.
But he felt no letup in the cold precision of his being. He sensed that his
new awareness was only a beginning, that it was growing. The sense of terrible
purpose he'd first experienced in his ordeal with the Reverend Mother Gaius
Helen Mohiam pervaded him. His right hand--the hand of remembered pain--tingled
and throbbed.
Is this what it is to be their Kwisatz Haderach? he wondered.
"For a while, I thought Hawat had failed us again, "Jessica said. "I thought
perhaps Yueh wasn't a Suk doctor."
"He was everything we thought him . . . and more," Paul said. And he
thought: Why is she so slow seeing these things? He said, "If Idaho doesn't get
through to Kynes, we'll be--"
"He's not our only hope," she said.
"Such was not my suggestion," he said.
She heard the steel in his voice, the sense of command, and stared across
the grey darkness of the stilltent at him. Paul was a silhouette against moonfrosted rocks seen through the tent's transparent end.
"Others among your father's men will have escaped," she said. "We must
regather them, find--"
"We will depend upon ourselves," he said. "Our immediate concern is our
family atomics. We must get them before the Harkonnens can search them out."
"Not likely they'll be found," she said, "the way they were hidden."
"It must not be left to chance."
And she thought: Blackmail with the family atomics as a threat to the planet
and its spice--that's what he has in mind. But all he can hope for then is
escape into renegade anonymity.
His mother's words had provoked another train of thought in Paul--a duke's
concern for all the people they'd lost this night. People are the true strength
of a Great House, Paul thought. And he remembered Hawat's words: "Parting with
people is a sadness; a place is only a place."
"They're using Sardaukar," Jessica said. "We must wait until the Sardaukar
have been withdrawn."
"They think us caught between the desert and the Sardaukar," Paul said.
"They intend that there be no Atreides survivors--total extermination. Do not
count on any of our people escaping."
"They cannot go on indefinitely risking exposure of the Emperor's part in
this."
"Can't they?"
"Some of our people are bound to escape."
"Are they?"
Jessica turned away, frightened of the bitter strength in her son's voice,
hearing the precise assessment of chances. She sensed that his mind had leaped
ahead of her, that it now saw more in some respects than she did. She had helped
train the intelligence which did this, but now she found herself fearful of it.
Her thoughts turned, seeking toward the lost sanctuary of her Duke, and tears
burned her eyes.
This is the way it had to be, Leto, she thought. "A time of love and a time
of grief." She rested her hand on her abdomen, awareness focused on the embryo
there. I have the Atreides daughter I was ordered to produce, but the Reverend
Mother was wrong: a daughter wouldn't have saved my Leto. This child is only
life reaching for the future in the midst of death. I conceived out of instinct
and not out of obedience.
"Try the communinet receiver again," Paul said.
The mind goes on working no matter how we try to hold it back, she thought.

Jessica found the tiny receiver Idaho had left for them, flipped its switch.
A green light glowed on the instrument's face. Tinny screeching came from its
speaker. She reduced the volume, hunted across the bands. A voice speaking
Atreides battle language came into the tent.
" . . . back and regroup at the ridge. Fedor reports no survivors in Carthag
and the Guild Bank has been sacked."
Carthag! Jessica thought. That was a Harkonnen hotbed.
"They're Sardaukar," the voice said. "Watch out for Sardaukar in Atreides
uniforms. They're . . . "
A roaring filled the speaker, then silence.
"Try the other bands," Paul said.
"Do you realize what that means?" Jessica asked.
"I expected it. They want the Guild to blame us for destruction of their
bank. With the Guild against us, we're trapped on Arrakis. Try the other bands."
She weighed his words: I expected it. What had happened to him? Slowly,
Jessica returned to the instrument. As she moved the bandslide, they caught
glimpses of violence in the few voices calling out in Atreides battle language:
" . . . fallback . . . " " . . . try to regroup at . . . " " . . . trapped in a
cave at . . . ."
And there was no mistaking the victorious exultation in the Harkonnen
gibberish that poured from the other bands. Sharp commands, battle reports.
There wasn't enough of it for Jessica to register and break the language, but
the tone was obvious.
Harkonnen victory.
Paul shook the pack beside him, hearing the two literjons of water gurgle
there. He took a deep breath, looked up through the transparent end of the tent
at the rock escarpment outlined against the stars. His left hand felt the
sphincter-seal of the tent's entrance. "It'll be dawn soon," he said. "We can
wait through the day for Idaho, but not through another night. In the desert,
you must travel by night and rest in shade through the day."
Remembered lore insinuated itself into Jessica's mind: Without a stillsuit,
a man sitting in shade on the desert needs five liters of water a day to
maintain body weight. She felt the slick-soft skin of the stillsuit against her
body, thinking how their lives depended on these garments.
"If we leave here, Idaho can't find us," she said.
"There are ways to make any man talk," he said. "If Idaho hasn't returned by
dawn, we must consider the possibility he has been captured. How long do you
think he could hold out?"
The question required no answer, and she sat in silence.
Paul lifted the seal on the pack, pulled out a tiny micromanual with glowtab
and magnifier. Green and orange letters leaped up at him from the pages:
"literjons, stilltent, energy caps, recaths, sandsnork, binoculars, stillsuit
repkit, baradye pistol, sinkchart, filt-plugs, paracompass, maker hooks,
thumpers, Fremkit, fire pillar . . . "
So many things for survival on the desert.
Presently, he put the manual aside on the tent floor.
"Where can we possibly go?" Jessica asked.
"My father spoke of desert power," Paul said. "The Harkonnens cannot rule
this planet without it. They've never ruled this planet, nor shall they. Not
even with ten thousand legions of Sardaukar."
"Paul, you can't think that--"
"We've all the evidence in our hands," he said. "Right here in this tent-the tent itself, this pack and its contents, these stillsuits. We know the Guild
wants a prohibitive price for weather satellites. We know that--"
"What've weather satellites to do with it?" she asked. "They couldn't
possibly . . . " She broke off.

Paul sensed the hyperalertness of his mind reading her reactions, computing
on minutiae. "You see it now," he said. "Satellites watch the terrain below.
There are things in the deep desert that will not bear frequent inspection."
"You're suggesting the Guild itself controls this planet?"
She was so slow.
"No!" he said. "The Fremen! They're paying the Guild for privacy, paying in
a coin that's freely available to anyone with desert power--spice. This is more
than a second-approximation answer; it's the straight-line computation. Depend
on it."
"Paul." Jessica said, "you're not a Mentat yet; you can't know for sure how-"
"I'll never be a Mentat," he said. "I'm something else . . . a freak."
"Paul! How can you say such--"
"Leave me alone!"
He turned away from her, looking out into the night. Why can't I mourn? he
wondered. He felt that every fiber of his being craved this release, but it
would be denied him forever.
Jessica had never heard such distress in her son's voice. She wanted to
reach out to him, hold him, comfort him, help him--but she sensed there was
nothing she could do. He had to solve this problem by himself.
The glowing tab of the Fremkit manual between them on the tent floor caught
her eye. She lifted it, glanced at the flyleaf, reading: "Manual of 'The
Friendly Desert,' the place full of life. Here are the ayat and burhan of Life.
Believe, and al-Lat shall never burn you."
It reads like the Azhar Book, she thought, recalling her studies of the
Great Secrets. Has a Manipulator of Religions been on Arrakis?
Paul lifted the paracompass from the pack, returned it, said: "Think of all
these special-application Fremen machines. They show unrivaled sophistication.
Admit it. The culture that made these things betrays depths no one suspected."
Hesitating, still worried by the harshness in his voice, Jessica returned to
the book, studied an illustrated constellation from the Arrakeen sky: "Muad'Dib:
The Mouse," and noted that the tail pointed north.
Paul stared into the tent's darkness at the dimly discerned movements of his
mother revealed by the manual's glowtab. Now is the time to carry out my
father's wish, he thought. I must give her his message now while she has time
for grief. Grief would inconvenience us later. And he found himself shocked by
precise logic.
"Mother," he said.
"Yes?"
She heard the change in his voice, felt coldness in her entrails at the
sound. Never had she heard such harsh control.
"My father is dead," he said.
She searched within herself for the coupling of fact and fact and fact--the
Bene Gesserit way of assessing data--and it came to her: the sensation of
terrifying loss.
Jessica nodded, unable to speak.
"My father charged me once," Paul said, "to give you a message if anything
happened to him. He feared you might believe he distrusted you."
That useless suspicion, she thought.
"He wanted you to know he never suspected you," Paul said, and explained the
deception, adding: "He wanted you to know he always trusted you completely,
always loved you and cherished you. He said he would sooner have mistrusted
himself and he had but one regret--that he never made you his Duchess."
She brushed the tears coursing down her cheeks, thought: What a stupid waste
of the body's water! But she knew this thought for what it was--the attempt to
retreat from grief into anger. Leto, my Leto, she thought. What terrible things
we do to those we love! With a violent motion, she extinguished the little
manual's glowtab.
Sobs shook her.
Paul heard his mother's grief and felt the emptiness within himself. I have
no grief, he thought. Why? Why? He felt the inability to grieve as a terrible
flaw.
"A time to get and time to lose," Jessica thought, quoting to herself from
the O.C. Bible. "A time to keep and a time to cast away; a time for love and a
time to hate; a time of war and a time of peace. "
Paul's mind had gone on in its chilling precision. He saw the avenues ahead
of them on this hostile planet. Without even the safety valve of dreaming, he
focused his prescient awareness, seeing it as a computation of most probable
futures, but with something more, an edge of mystery--as though his mind dipped
into some timeless stratum and sampled the winds of the future.
Abruptly, as though he had found a necessary key, Paul's mind climbed
another notch in awareness. He felt himself clinging to this new level,
clutching at a precarious hold and peering about. It was as though he existed
within a globe with avenues radiating away in all directions . . . yet this only
approximated the sensation.
He remembered once seeing a gauze kerchief blowing in the wind and now he
sensed the future as though it twisted across some surface as undulant and
impermanent as that of the windblown kerchief.
He saw people.
He felt the heat and cold of uncounted probabilities.
He knew names and places, experienced emotions without number, reviewed data
of innumerable unexplored crannies. There was time to probe and test and taste,
but no time to shape.
The thing was a spectrum of possibilities from the most remote past to the
most remote future--from the most probable to the most improbable. He saw his
own death in countless ways. He saw new planets, new cultures.
People.
People.
He saw them in such swarms they could not be listed, yet his mind catalogued
them.
Even the Guildsmen.
And he thought: The Guild--there' d be a way for us, my strangeness accepted
as a familiar thing of high value, always with an assured supply of the nownecessary spice.
But the idea of living out his life in the mind-groping-ahead-throughpossible-futures that guided hurtling spaceships appalled him. It was a way,
though. And in meeting the possible future that contained Guildsmen he
recognized his own strangeness.
I have another kind of sight. I see another kind of terrain: the available
paths.
The awareness conveyed both reassurance and alarm--so many places on that
other kind of terrain dipped or turned out of his sight.
As swiftly as it had come, the sensation slipped away from him, and he
realized the entire experience had taken the space of a heartbeat.
Yet, his own personal awareness had been turned over, illuminated in a
terrifying way. He stared around him.
Night still covered the stilltent within its rock-enclosed hideaway. His
mother's grief could still be heard.
His own lack of grief could still be felt . . . that hollow place somewhere
separated from his mind, which went on in its steady pace--dealing with data,
evaluating, computing, submitting answers in something like the Mentat way.
And now he saw that he had a wealth of data few such minds ever before had
encompassed. But this made the empty place within him no easier to bear. He felt
that something must shatter. It was as though a clockwork control for a bomb had
been set to ticking within him. It went on about its business no matter what he
wanted. It recorded minuscule shadings of difference around him--a slight change
in moisture, a fractional fall in temperature, the progress of an insect across
their stilltent roof, the solemn approach of dawn in the starlighted patch of
sky he could see out the tent's transparent end.
The emptiness was unbearable. Knowing how the clockwork had been set in
motion made no difference. He could look to his own past and see the start of
it--the training, the sharpening of talents, the refined pressures of
sophisticated disciplines, even exposure to the O.C. Bible at a critical moment
. . . and, lastly, the heavy intake of spice. And he could look ahead--the most
terrifying direction--to see where it all pointed.
I'm a monster! he thought. A freak!
"No," he said. Then: "No. No! NO!"
He found that he was pounding the tent floor with his fists. (The implacable
part of him recorded this as an interesting emotional datum and fed it into
computation.)
"Paul!"
His mother was beside him, holding his hands, her face a gray blob peering
at him. "Paul, what's wrong?"
"You!" he said.
"I'm here, Paul," she said. "It's all right."
"What have you done to me?" he demanded.
In a burst of clarity, she sensed some of the roots in the question, said:
"I gave birth to you."
It was, from instinct as much as her own subtle knowledge, the precisely
correct answer to calm him. He felt her hands holding him, focused on the dim
outline of her face. (Certain gene traces in her facial structure were noted in
the new way by his onflowing mind, the clues added to other data, and a finalsummation answer put forward.)
"Let go of me," he said.
She heard the iron in his voice, obeyed. "Do you want to tell me what's
wrong, Paul?"
"Did you know what you were doing when you trained me?" he asked.
There's no more childhood in his voice, she thought. And she said: "I hoped
the thing any parent hopes--that you'd be . . . superior, different."
"Different?"
She heard the bitterness in his tone, said: "Paul, I--"
"You didn't want a son!" he said. "You wanted a Kwisatz Haderach! You wanted
a male Bene Gesserit!"
She recoiled from his bitterness. "But Paul . . ."
"Did you ever consult my father in this?"
She spoke gently out of the freshness of her grief: "Whatever you are, Paul,
the heredity is as much your father as me."
"But not the training," he said. "Not the things that . . . awakened . . .
the sleeper."
"Sleeper?"
"It's here." He put a hand to his head and then to his breast. "In me. It
goes on and on and on and on and--"
"Paul!"
She had heard the hysteria edging his voice.
"Listen to me," he said. "You wanted the Reverend Mother to hear about my
dreams: You listen in her place now. I've just had a waking dream. Do you know
why?"
"You must calm yourself," she said. "If there's--"
"The spice," he said, "It's in everything here--the air, the soil, the food.
The geriatric spice. It's like the Truthsayer drug. It's a poison!"
She stiffened.
His voice lowered and he repeated: "A poison--so subtle, so insidious . . .
so irreversible. It won't even kill you unless you stop taking it. We can't
leave Arrakis unless we take part of Arrakis with us."
The terrifying presence of his voice brooked no dispute.
"You and the spice," Paul said. "The spice changes anyone who gets this much
of it, but thanks to you, I could bring the change to consciousness. I don't get
to leave it in the unconscious where its disturbance can be blanked out. I can
see it."
"Paul, you--"
"I see it!" he repeated.
She heard madness in his voice, didn't know what to do.
But he spoke again, and she heard the iron control return to him: "We're
trapped here."
We're trapped here, she agreed.
And she accepted the truth of his words. No pressure of the Bene Gesserit,
no trickery or artifice could pry them completely free from Arrakis: the spice
was addictive. Her body had known the fact long before her mind awakened to it.
So here we live out our lives, she thought, on this hell-planet. The place
is prepared for us, if we can evade the Harkonnens. And there's no doubt of my
course: a broodmare preserving an important bloodline for the Bene Gesserit
Plan.
"I must tell you about my waking dream," Paul said. (Now there was fury in
his voice.) "To be sure you accept what I say, I'll tell you first I know you'll
bear a daughter, my sister, here on Arrakis."
Jessica placed her hands against the tent floor, pressed back against the
curving fabric wall to still a pang of fear. She knew her pregnancy could not
show yet. Only her own Bene Gesserit training had allowed her to read the first
faint signals of her body, to know of the embryo only a few weeks old.
"Only to serve," Jessica whispered, clinging to the Bene Gesserit motto. "We
exist only to serve."
"We'll find a home among the Fremen," Paul said, "where your Missionaria
Protectiva has bought us a bolt hole."
They've prepared a way for us in the desert, Jessica told herself. But how
can he know of the Missionaria Protectiva? She found it increasingly difficult
to subdue her terror at the overpowering strangeness in Paul.
He studied the dark shadow of her, seeing her fear and every reaction with
his new awareness as though she were outlined in blinding light. A beginning of
compassion for her crept over him.
"The things that can happen here, I cannot begin to tell you," he said. "I
cannot even begin to tell myself, although I've seen them. This sense of the
future--I seem to have no control over it. The thing just happens. The immediate
future--say, a year--I can see some of that . . . a road as broad as our Central
Avenue on Caladan. Some places I don't see . . . shadowed places . . . as though
it went behind a hill" (and again he thought of the surface of a blowing
kerchief) " . . . and there are branchings . . . "
He fell silent as memory of that seeing filled him. No prescient dream, no
experience of his life had quite prepared him for the totality with which the
veils had been ripped away to reveal naked time.
Recalling the experience, he recognized his own terrible purpose--the
pressure of his life spreading outward like an expanding bubble . . . time
retreating before it . . .
Jessica found the tent's glowtab control, activated it.
Dim green light drove back the shadows, easing her fear. She looked at
Paul's face, his eyes--the inward stare. And she knew where she had seen such a
look before: pictured in records of disasters--on the faces of children who
experienced starvation or terrible injury. The eyes were like pits, mouth a
straight line, cheeks indrawn.
It's the look of terrible awareness, she thought, of someone forced to the
knowledge of his own mortality.
He was, indeed, no longer a child.
The underlying import of his words began to take over in her mind, pushing
all else aside. Paul could see ahead, a way of escape for them.
"There's a way to evade the Harkonnens," she said.
"The Harkonnens!" he sneered. "Put those twisted humans out of your mind."
He stared at his mother, studying the lines of her face in the light of the
glowtab. The lines betrayed her.
She said: "You shouldn't refer to people as humans without--"
"Don't be so sure you know where to draw the line," he said. "We carry our
past with us. And, mother mine, there's a thing you don't know and should--we
are Harkonnens."
Her mind did a terrifying thing: it blanked out as though it needed to shut
off all sensation. But Paul's voice went on at that implacable pace, dragging
her with it.
"When next you find a mirror, study your face--study mine now. The traces
are there if you don't blind yourself. Look at my hands, the set of my bones.
And if none of this convinces you, then take my word for it. I've walked the
future, I've looked at a record, I've seen a place, I have all the data. We're
Harkonnens."
"A . . . renegade branch of the family," she said. "That's it, isn't it?
Some Harkonnen cousin who--"
"You're the Baron's own daughter," he said, and watched the way she pressed
her hands to her mouth. "The Baron sampled many pleasures in his youth, and once
permitted himself to be seduced. But it was for the genetic purposes of the Bene
Gesserit, by one of you."
The way he said 'you' struck her like a slap. But it set her mind to working
and she could not deny his words. So many blank ends of meaning in her past
reached out now and linked. The daughter the Bene Gesserit wanted--it wasn't to
end the old Atreides-Harkonnen feud, but to fix some genetic factor in their
lines. What? She groped for an answer.
As though he saw inside her mind, Paul said: "They thought they were
reaching for me. But I'm not what they expected, and I've arrived before my
time. And they don't know it."
Jessica pressed her hands to her mouth.
Great Mother! He's the Kwisatz Haderach!
She felt exposed and naked before him, realizing then that he saw her with
eyes from which little could be hidden. And that, she knew, was the basis of her
fear.
"You're thinking I'm the Kwisatz Haderach," he said. "Put that out of your
mind. I'm something unexpected."
I must get word out to one of the schools, she thought. The mating index may
show what has happened.
"They won't learn about me until it's too late," he said.
She sought to divert him, lowered her hands and said: "We'll find a place
among the Fremen?"
"The Fremen have a saying they credit to Shai-hulud, Old Father Eternity,"
he said. "They say: 'Be prepared to appreciate what you meet.' "
And he thought: Yes, mother mine--among the Fremen. You'll acquire the blue
eyes and a callus beside your lovely nose from the filter tube to your stillsuit
. . . and you'll bear my sister: St. Alia of the Knife.
"If you're not the Kwisatz Haderach," Jessica said, "what--"
"You couldn't possibly know," he said. "You won't believe it until you see
it."
And he thought: I'm a seed.
He suddenly saw how fertile was the ground into which he had fallen, and
with this realization, the terrible purpose filled him, creeping through the
empty place within, threatening to choke him with grief.
He had seen two main branchings along the way ahead--in one he confronted an
evil old Baron and said: "Hello, Grandfather." The thought of that path and what
lay along it sickened him.
The other path held long patches of grey obscurity except for peaks of
violence. He had seen a warrior religion there, a fire spreading across the
universe with the Atreides green and black banner waving at the head of fanatic
legions drunk on spice liquor. Gurney Halleck and a few others of his father's
men--a pitiful few--were among them, all marked by the hawk symbol from the
shrine of his father's skull.
"I can't go that way," he muttered. "That's what the old witches of your
schools really want."
"I don't understand you, Paul," his mother said.
He remained silent, thinking like the seed he was, thinking with the race
consciousness he had first experienced as terrible purpose. He found that he no
longer could hate the Bene Gesserit or the Emperor or even the Harkonnens. They
were all caught up in the need of their race to renew its scattered inheritance,
to cross and mingle and infuse their bloodlines in a great new pooling of genes.
And the race knew only one sure way for this--the ancient way, the tried and
certain way that rolled over everything in its path: jihad.
Surely, I cannot choose that way, he thought.
But he saw again in his mind's eye the shrine of his father's skull and the
violence with the green and black banner waving in its midst.
Jessica cleared her throat, worried by his silence. "Then . . . the Fremen
will give us sanctuary?"
He looked up, staring across the green-lighted tent at the inbred, patrician
lines of her face. "Yes," he said. "That's one of the ways." He nodded. "Yes.
They'll call me . . . Muad'Dib, 'The One Who Points the Way.' Yes . . . that's
what they'll call me."
And he closed his eyes, thinking: Now, my father, I can mourn you. And he
felt the tears coursing down his cheeks.

When my father, the Padishah Emperor, heard of Duke Leto's death and the manner
of it, he went into such a rage as we had never before seen. He blamed my mother
and the compact forced on him to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne. He blamed
the Guild and the evil old Baron. He blamed everyone in sight, not excepting
even me, for he said I was a witch like all the others. And when I sought to
comfort him, saying it was done according to an older law of self-preservation
to which even the most ancient rulers gave allegiance, he sneered at me and
asked if I thought him a weakling. I saw then that he had been aroused to this
passion not by concern over the dead Duke but by what that death implied for all
royalty. As I look back on it, I think there may have been some prescience in my
father, too, for it is certain that his line and Muad'Dib's shared common
ancestry.
-"In My Father's House," by the Princess Irulan
"Now Harkonnen shall kill Harkonnen," Paul whispered.

He had awakened shortly before nightfall, sitting up in the sealed and
darkened stilltent. As he spoke, he heard the vague stirrings of his mother
where she slept against the tent's opposite wall.
Paul glanced at the proximity detector on the floor, studying the dials
illuminated in the blackness by phosphor tubes.
"It should be night soon," his mother said. "Why don't you lift the tent
shades?"
Paul realized then that her breathing had been different for some time, that
she had lain silent in the darkness until certain he was awake.
"Lifting the shades wouldn't help," he said. "There's been a storm. The
tent's covered by sand. I'll dig us out soon."
"No sign of Duncan yet?"
"None."
Paul rubbed absently at the ducal signet on his thumb, and a sudden rage
against the very substance of this planet which had helped kill his father set
him trembling.
"I heard the storm begin," Jessica said.
The undemanding emptiness of her words helped restore some of his calm. His
mind focused on the storm as he had seen it begin through the transparent end of
their stilltent--cold dribbles of sand crossing the basin, then runnels and
tails furrowing the sky. He had looked up to a rock spire, seen it change shape
under the blast, becoming a low, Cheddar-colored wedge. Sand funneled into their
basin had shadowed the sky with dull curry, then blotted out all light as the
tent was covered.
Tent bows had creaked once as they accepted the pressure, then--silence
broken only by the dim bellows wheezing of their sand snorkel pumping air from
the surface.
"Try the receiver again," Jessica said.
"No use," he said.
He found his stillsuit's watertube in its clip at his neck, drew a warm
swallow into his mouth, and he thought that here he truly began an Arrakeen
existence--living on reclaimed moisture from his own breath and body. It was
flat and tasteless water, but it soothed his throat.
Jessica heard Paul drinking, felt the slickness of her own stillsuit
clinging to her body, but she refused to accept her thirst. To accept it would
require awakening fully into the terrible necessities of Arrakis where they must
guard even fractional traces of moisture, hoarding the few drops in the tent's
catchpockets, begrudging a breath wasted on the open air.
So much easier to drift back down into sleep.
But there had been a dream in this day's sleep, and she shivered at memory
of it. She had held dreaming hands beneath sandflow where a name had been
written: Duke Leto Atreides. The name had blurred with the sand and she had
moved to restore it, but the first letter filled before the last was begun.
The sand would not stop.
Her dream became wailing: louder and louder. That ridiculous wailing--part
of her mind had realized the sound was her own voice as a tiny child, little
more than a baby. A woman not quite visible to memory was going away.
My unknown mother, Jessica thought. The Bene Gesserit who bore me and gave
me to the Sisters because that's what she was commanded to do. Was she glad to
rid herself of a Harkonnen child?
"The place to hit them is in the spice," Paul said.
How can he think of attack at a time like this? she asked herself.
"An entire planet full of spice," she said. "How can you hit them there?"
She heard him stirring, the sound of their pack being dragged across the
tent floor.
"It was sea power and air power on Caladan," he said. "Here, it's desert
power. The Fremen are the key."
His voice came from the vicinity of the tent's sphincter. Her Bene Gesserit
training sensed in his tone an unresolved bitterness toward her.
All his life he has been trained to hate Harkonnens, she thought. Now, he
finds he is Harkonnen . . . because of me. How little he knows me! I was my
Duke's only woman. I accepted his life and his values even to defying my Bene
Gesserit orders.
The tent's glowtab came alight under Paul's hand, filled the domed area with
green radiance. Paul crouched at the sphincter, his stillsuit hood adjusted for
the open desert--forehead capped, mouth filter in place, nose plugs adjusted.
Only his dark eyes were visible: a narrow band of face that turned once toward
her and away.
"Secure yourself for the open," he said, and his voice was blurred behind
the filter.
Jessica pulled the filter across her mouth, began adjusting her hood as she
watched Paul break the tent seal.
Sand rasped as he opened the sphincter and a burred fizzle of grains ran
into the tent before he could immobilize it with a static compaction tool. A
hole grew in the sandwall as the tool realigned the grains. He slipped out and
her ears followed his progress to the surface.
What will we find out there? she wondered. Harkonnen troops and the
Sardaukar, those are dangers we can expect. But what of the dangers we don't
know?
She thought of the compaction tool and the other strange instruments in the
pack. Each of these tools suddenly stood in her mind as a sign of mysterious
dangers.
She felt then a hot breeze from surface sand touch her cheeks where they
were exposed above the filter.
"Pass up the pack." It was Paul's voice, low and guarded.
She moved to obey, heard the water literjons gurgle as she shoved the pack
across the floor. She peered upward, saw Paul framed against stars.
"Here," he said and reached down, pulled the pack to the surface.
Now she saw only the circle of stars. They were like the luminous tips of
weapons aimed down at her. A shower of meteors crossed her patch of night. The
meteors seemed to her like a warning, like tiger stripes, like luminous grave
slats clabbering her blood. And she felt the chill of the price on their heads.
"Hurry up," Paul said. "I want to collapse the tent."
A shower of sand from the surface brushed her left hand. How much sand will
the hand hold? She asked herself.
"Shall I help you?" Paul asked.
"No."
She swallowed in a dry throat, slipped into the hole, felt static-packed
sand rasp under her hands. Paul reached down, took her arm. She stood beside him
on a smooth patch of starlit desert, stared around. Sand almost brimmed their
basin, leaving only a dim lip of surrounding rock. She probed the farther
darkness with her trained senses.
Noise of small animals.
Birds.
A fall of dislodged sand and faint creature sounds within it.
Paul collapsing their tent, recovering it up the hole.
Starlight displaced just enough of the night to charge each shadow with
menace. She looked at patches of blackness.
Black is a blind remembering, she thought. You listen for pack sounds, for
the cries of those who hunted your ancestors in a past so ancient only your most
primitive cells remember. The ears see. The nostrils see.
Presently, Paul stood beside her, said: "Duncan told me that if he was
captured, he could hold out . . . this long. We must leave here now." He
shouldered the pack, crossed to the shallow lip of the basin, climbed to a ledge
that looked down on open desert.
Jessica followed automatically, noting how she now lived in her son's orbit.
For now is my grief heavier than the sands of the seas, she thought. This
world has emptied me of all but the oldest purpose: tomorrow's life. I live now
for my young Duke and the daughter yet to be.
She felt the sand drag her feet as she climbed to Paul's side.
He looked north across a line of rocks, studying a distant escarpment.
The faraway rock profile was like an ancient battleship of the seas outlined
by stars. The long swish of it lifted on an invisible wave with syllables of
boomerang antennae, funnels arcing back, a pi-shaped upthrusting at the stern.
An orange glare burst above the silhouette and a line of brilliant purple
cut downward toward the glare.
Another line of purple!
And another upthrusting orange glare!
It was like an ancient naval battle, remembered shellfire, and the sight
held them staring.
"Pillars of fire," Paul whispered.
A ring of red eyes lifted over the distant rock. Lines of purple laced the
sky.
"Jetflares and lasguns," Jessica said.
The dust-reddened first moon of Arrakis lifted above the horizon to their
left and they saw a storm trail there--a ribbon of movement over the desert.
"It must be Harkonnen 'thopters hunting us," Paul said. "The way they're
cutting up the desert . . . it's as though they were making certain they stamped
out whatever's there . . . the way you'd stamp out a nest of insects."
"Or a nest of Atreides," Jessica said.
"We must seek cover," Paul said. "We'll head south and keep to the rocks. If
they caught us in the open . . ." He turned, adjusting the pack to his
shoulders. "They're killing anything that moves."
He took one step along the ledge and, in that instant, heard the low hiss of
gliding aircraft, saw the dark shapes of ornithopters above them.

"I've always prided myself on seeing things the way they truly are," Thufir
Hawat said. "That's the curse of being a Mentat. You can't stop analyzing your
data."
The leathered old face appeared composed in the predawn dimness as he spoke.
His sapho-stained lips were drawn into a straight line with radial creases
spreading upward.
A robed man squatted silently on sand across from Hawat, apparently unmoved
by the words.
The two crouched beneath a rock overhang that looked down on a wide, shallow
sink. Dawn was spreading over the shattered outline of cliffs across the basin,
touching everything with pink. It was cold under the overhang, a dry and
penetrating chill left over from the night. There had been a warm wind just
before dawn, but now it was cold. Hawat could hear teeth chattering behind him
among the few troopers remaining in his force.
The man squatting across from Hawat was a Fremen who had come across the
sink in the first light of false dawn, skittering over the sand, blending into
the dunes, his movements barely discernible.

The Fremen extended a finger to the sand between them, drew a figure there.
It looked like a bowl with an arrow spilling out of it. "There are many
Harkonnen patrols," he said. He lifted his finger, pointed upward across the
cliffs that Hawat and his men had descended.
Hawat nodded.
Many patrols. Yes.
But still he did not know what this Fremen wanted and this rankled. Mentat
training was supposed to give a man the power to see motives.
This had been the worst night of Hawat's life. He had been at Tsimpo, a
garrison village, buffer outpost for the former capital city, Carthag, when the
reports of attack began arriving. At first, he'd thought: It's a raid. The
Harkonnens are testing.
But report followed report--faster and faster.
Two legions landed at Carthag.
Five legions--fifty brigades! --attacking the Duke's main base at Arrakeen.
A legion at Arsunt.
Two battle groups at Splintered Rock.
Then the reports became more detailed--there were Imperial Sardaukar among
the attackers--possibly two legions of them. And it became clear that the
invaders knew precisely which weight of arms to send where. Precisely! Superb
Intelligence.
Hawat's shocked fury had mounted until it threatened the smooth functioning
of his Mentat capabilities. The size of the attack struck his mind like a
physical blow.
Now, hiding beneath a bit of desert rock, he nodded to himself, pulled his
torn and slashed tunic around him as though warding off the cold shadows.
The size of the attack.
He had always expected their enemy to hire an occasional lighter from the
Guild for probing raids. That was an ordinary enough gambit in this kind of
House-to-House warfare. Lighters landed and took off on Arrakis regularly to
transport the spice for House Atreides. Hawat had taken precautions against
random raids by false spice lighters. For a full attack they'd expected no more
than ten brigades.
But there were more than two thousand ships down on Arrakis at the last
count--not just lighters, but frigates, scouts, monitors, crushers, troopcarriers, dump-boxes . . .
More than a hundred brigades--ten legions!
The entire spice income of Arrakis for fifty years might just cover the cost
of such a venture.
It might.
I underestimated what the Baron was willing to spend in attacking us, Hawat
thought. I failed my Duke.
Then there was the matter of the traitor.
I will live long enough to see her strangled! he thought. I should've killed
that Bene Gesserit witch when I had the chance. There was no doubt in his mind
who had betrayed them--the Lady Jessica. She fitted all the facts available.
"Your man Gurney Halleck and part of his force are safe with our smuggler
friends," the Fremen said.
"Good."
So Gurney will get off this hell planet. We 're not all gone.
Hawat glanced back at the huddle of his men. He had started the night just
past with three hundred of his finest. Of those, an even twenty remained and
half of them were wounded. Some of them slept now, standing up, leaning against
the rock, sprawled on the sand beneath the rock. Their last 'thopter, the one
they'd been using as a ground-effect machine to carry their wounded, had given
out just before dawn. They had cut it up with lasguns and hidden the pieces,
then worked their way down into this hiding place at the edge of the basin.

Hawat had only a rough idea of their location--some two hundred kilometers
southeast of Arrakeen. The main traveled ways between the Shield Wall sietch
communities were somewhere south of them.
The Fremen across from Hawat threw back his hood and stillsuit cap to reveal
sandy hair and beard. The hair was combed straight back from a high, thin
forehead. He had the unreadable total blue eyes of the spice diet. Beard and
mustache were stained at one side of the mouth, his hair matted there by
pressure of the looping catchtube from his nose plugs.
The man removed his plugs, readjusted them. He rubbed at a scar beside his
nose.
"If you cross the sink here this night," the Fremen said, "you must not use
shields. There is a break in the wall . . . " He turned on his heels, pointed
south. " . . . there, and it is open sand down to the erg. Shields will attract
a . . . " He hesitated. ". . . worm. They don't often come in here, but a shield
will bring one every time."
He said worm, Hawat thought. He was going to say something else. What? And
what does he want of us?
Hawat sighed.
He could not recall ever before being this tired. It was a muscle weariness
that energy pills were unable to ease.
Those damnable Sardaukar!
With a self-accusing bitterness, he faced the thought of the soldierfanatics and the Imperial treachery they represented. His own Mentat assessment
of the data told him how little chance he had ever to present evidence of this
treachery before the High Council of the Landsraad where justice might be done.
"Do you wish to go to the smugglers?" the Fremen asked.
"Is it possible?"
"The way is long."
"Fremen don't like to say no," Idaho had told him once.
Hawat said: "You haven't yet told me whether your people can help my
wounded."
"They are wounded."
The same damned answer every time!
"We know they're wounded!" Hawat snapped. "That's not the--"
"Peace, friend," the Fremen cautioned. "What do your wounded say? Are there
those among them who can see the water need of your tribe?"
"We haven't talked about water," Hawat said. "We--"
"I can understand your reluctance," the Fremen said. "They are your friends,
your tribesmen. Do you have water?"
"Not enough."
The Fremen gestured to Hawat's tunic, the skin exposed beneath it. "You were
caught in-sietch, without your suits. You must make a water decision, friend."
"Can we hire your help?"
The Fremen shrugged. "You have no water." He glanced at the group behind
Hawat. "How many of your wounded would you spend?"
Hawat fell silent, staring at the man. He could see as a Mentat that their
communication was out of phase. Word-sounds were not being linked up here in the
normal manner.
"I am Thufir Hawat," he said. "I can speak for my Duke. I will make
promissory commitment now for your help. I wish a limited form of help,
preserving my force long enough only to kill a traitor who thinks herself beyond
vengeance."
"You wish our siding in a vendetta?"
"The vendetta I'll handle myself. I wish to be freed of responsibility for
my wounded that I may get about it."
The Fremen scowled. "How can you be responsible for your wounded? They are
their own responsibility. The water's at issue, Thufir Hawat. Would you have me
take that decision away from you?"
The man put a hand to a weapon concealed beneath his robe.
Hawat tensed, wondering: Is there betrayal here?
"What do you fear?" the Fremen demanded.
These people and their disconcerting directness! Hawat spoke cautiously.
"There's a price on my head."
"Ah-h-h-h." The Fremen removed his hand from his weapon. "You think we have
the Byzantine corruption. You don't know us. The Harkonnens have not water
enough to buy the smallest child among us."
But they had the price of Guild passage for more than two thousand fighting
ships, Hawat thought. And the size of that price still staggered him.
"We both fight Harkonnens," Hawat said. "Should we not share the problems
and ways of meeting the battle issue?"
"We are sharing," the Fremen said. "I have seen you fight Harkonnens. You
are good. There've been times I'd have appreciated your arm beside me."
"Say where my arm may help you," Hawat said.
"Who knows?" the Fremen asked. "There are Harkonnen forces everywhere. But
you still have not made the water decision or put it to your wounded."
I must be cautious, Hawat told himself. There's a thing here that's not
understood.
He said: "Will you show me your way, the Arrakeen way?"
"Stranger-thinking," the Fremen said, and there was a sneer in his tone. He
pointed to the northwest across the clifftop. "We watched you come across the
sand last night." He lowered his arm. "You keep your force on the slip-face of
the dunes. Bad. You have no stillsuits, no water. You will not last long."
"The ways of Arrakis don't come easily," Hawat said.
"Truth. But we've killed Harkonnens."
"What do you do with your own wounded? "Hawat demanded.
"Does a man not know when he is worth saving?" the Fremen asked. "Your
wounded know you have no water." He tilted his head, looking sideways up at
Hawat. "This is clearly a time for water decision. Both wounded and unwounded
must look to the tribe's future."
The tribe's future, Hawat thought. The tribe of Atreides. There's sense in
that. He forced himself to the question he had been avoiding.
"Have you word of my Duke or his son?"
Unreadable blue eyes stared upward into Hawat's. "Word?"
"Their fate!" Hawat snapped.
"Fate is the same for everyone," the Fremen said. "Your Duke, it is said,
has met his fate. As to the Lisan al-Gaib, his son, that is in Liet's hands.
Liet has not said."
I knew the answer without asking, Hawat thought.
He glanced back at his men. They were all awake now. They had heard. They
were staring out across the sand, the realization in their expressions: there
was no returning to Caladan for them, and now Arrakis was lost.
Hawat turned back to the Fremen. "Have you heard of Duncan Idaho?"
"He was in the great house when the shield went down," the Fremen said.
"This I've heard . . . no more."
She dropped the shield and let in the Harkonnens, he thought. I was the one
who sat with my back to a door. How could she do this when it meant turning also
against her own son? But . . . who knows how a Bene Gesserit witch thinks . . .
if you can call it thinking?
Hawat tried to swallow in a dry throat. "When will you hear about the boy?"
"We know little of what happens in Arrakeen," the Fremen said. He shrugged.
"Who knows?"
"You have ways of finding out?"
"Perhaps." The Fremen rubbed at the scar beside his nose. "Tell me, Thufir
Hawat, do you have knowledge of the big weapons the Harkonnens used?"
The artillery, Hawat thought bitterly. Who could have guessed they'd use
artillery in this day of shields?
"You refer to the artillery they used to trap our people in the caves," he
said. "I've . . . theoretical knowledge of such explosive weapons."
"Any man who retreats into a cave which has only one opening deserves to
die," the Fremen said.
"Why do you ask about these weapons?"
"Liet wishes it."
Is that what he wants from us? Hawat wondered. He said: "Did you come here
seeking information about the big guns?"
"Liet wished to see one of the weapons for himself."
"Then you should just go take one," Hawat sneered.
"Yes," the Fremen said. "We took one. We have it hidden where Stilgar can
study it for Liet and where Liet can see it for himself if he wishes. But I
doubt he'll want to: the weapon is not a very good one. Poor design for
Arrakis."
"You . . . took one?" Hawat asked.
"It was a good fight," the Fremen said. "We lost only two men and spilled
the water from more than a hundred of theirs."
There were Sardaukar at every gun, Hawat thought. This desert madman speaks
casually of losing only two men against Sardaukar!
"We would not have lost the two except for those others fighting beside the
Harkonnens," the Fremen said. "Some of those are good fighters."
One of Hawat's men limped forward, looked down at the squatting Fremen. "Are
you talking about Sardaukar?"
"He's talking about Sardaukar," Hawat said.
"Sardaukar!" the Fremen said, and there appeared to be glee in his voice.
"Ah-h-h, so that's what they are! This was a good night indeed. Sardaukar. Which
legion? Do you know?"
"We . . . don't know," Hawat said.
"Sardaukar," the Fremen mused. "Yet they wear Harkonnen clothing. Is that
not strange?"
"The Emperor does not wish it known he fights against a Great House," Hawat
said.
"But you know they are Sardaukar."
"Who am I?" Hawat asked bitterly.
"You are Thufir Hawat," the man said matter-of-factly. "Well, we would have
learned it in time. We've sent three of them captive to be questioned by Liet's
men."
Hawat's aide spoke slowly, disbelief in every word: "You . . . captured
Sardaukar?"
"Only three of them," the Fremen said. "They fought well."
If only we'd had the time to link up with these Fremen, Hawat thought. It
was a sour lament in his mind. If only we could've trained them and armed them.
Great Mother, what a fighting force we'd have had!
"Perhaps you delay because of worry over the Lisan al-Gaib," the Fremen
said. "If he is truly the Lisan al-Gaib, harm cannot touch him. Do not spend
thoughts on a matter which has not been proved."
"I serve the . . . Lisan al-Gaib," Hawat said. "His welfare is my concern.
I've pledged myself to this."
"You are pledged to his water?"
Hawat glanced at his aide, who was still staring at the Fremen, returned his
attention to the squatting figure. "To his water, yes."
"You wish to return to Arrakeen, to the place of his water?"
"To . . . yes, to the place of his water."
"Why did you not say at first it was a water matter?" The Fremen stood up,
seated his nose plugs firmly.
Hawat motioned with his head for his aide to return to the others. With a
tired shrug, the man obeyed. Hawat heard a low-voiced conversation arise among
the men.
The Fremen said: "There is always a way to water."
Behind Hawat, a man cursed. Hawat's aide called: "Thufir! Arkie just died."
The Fremen put a fist to his ear. "The bond of water! It's a sign!" He
stared at Hawat. "We have a place nearby for accepting the water. Shall I call
my men?"
The aide returned to Hawat's side, said: "Thufir, a couple of the men left
wives in Arrakeen. They're . . . well, you know how it is at a time like this."
The Fremen still held his fist to his ear. "Is it the bond of water, Thufir
Hawat?" he demanded.
Hawat's mind was racing. He sensed now the direction of the Fremen's words,
but feared the reaction of the tired men under the rock overhang when they
understood it.
"The bond of water," Hawat said.
"Let our tribes be joined," the Fremen said, and he lowered his fist.
As though that were the signal, four men slid and dropped down from the
rocks above them. They darted back under the overhang, rolled the dead man in a
loose robe, lifted him and began running with him along the cliff wall to the
right. Spurts of dust lifted around their running feet.
It was over before Hawat's tired men could gather their wits. The group with
the body hanging like a sack in its enfolding robe was gone around a turn in the
cliff.
One of Hawat's men shouted: "Where they going with Arkie? He was--"
"They're taking him to . . . bury him," Hawat said.
"Fremen don't bury their dead!" the man barked. "Don't you try any tricks on
us, Thufir. We know what they do. Arkie was one of--"
"Paradise were sure for a man who died in the service of Lisan al-Gaib," the
Fremen said. "If it is the Lisan al-Gaib you serve, as you have said it, why
raise mourning cries? The memory of one who died in this fashion will live as
long as the memory of man endures."
But Hawat's men advanced, angry looks on their faces. One had captured a
lasgun. He started to draw it.
"Stop right where you are!" Hawat barked. He fought down the sick fatigue
that gripped his muscles. "These people respect our dead. Customs differ, but
the meaning's the same."
"They're going to render Arkie down for his water," the man with the lasgun
snarled.
"Is it that your men wish to attend the ceremony?" the Fremen asked.
He doesn't even see the problem, Hawat thought. The naivete of the Fremen
was frightening.
"They're concerned for a respected comrade," Hawat said.
"We will treat your comrade with the same reverence we treat our own," the
Fremen said. "This is the bond of water. We know the rites. A man's flesh is his
own; the water belongs to the tribe."
Hawat spoke quickly as the man with the lasgun advanced another step. "Will
you now help our wounded?"
"One does not question the bond," the Fremen said. "We will do for you what
a tribe does for its own. First, we must get all of you suited and see to the
necessities."
The man with the lasgun hesitated.
Hawat's aide said: "Are we buying help with Arkie's . . . water?"
"Not buying," Hawat said. "We've joined these people."
"Customs differ," one of his men muttered.

Hawat began to relax.
"And they'll help us get to Arrakeen?"
"We will kill Harkonnens," the Fremen said. He grinned. "And Sardaukar." He
stepped backward, cupped his hands beside his ears and tipped his head back,
listening. Presently, he lowered his hands, said: "An aircraft comes. Conceal
yourselves beneath the rock and remain' motionless."
At a gesture from Hawat, his men obeyed.
The Fremen took Hawat's arm, pressed him back with the others. "We will
fight in the time of fighting," the man said. He reached beneath his robes,
brought out a small cage, lifted a creature from it.
Hawat recognized a tiny bat. The bat turned its head and Hawat saw its bluewithin-blue eyes.
The Fremen stroked the bat, soothing it, crooning to it. He bent over the
animal's head, allowed a drop of saliva to fall from his tongue into the bat's
upturned mouth. The bat stretched its wings, but remained on the Fremen's opened
hand. The man took a tiny tube, held it beside the bat's head and chattered into
the tube; then, lifting the creature high, he threw it upward.
The bat swooped away beside the cliff and was lost to sight.
The Fremen folded the cage, thrust it beneath his robe. Again, he bent his
head, listening. "They quarter the high country," he said. "One wonders who they
seek up there."
"It's known that we retreated in this direction," Hawat said.
"One should never presume one is the sole object of a hunt," the Fremen
said. "Watch the other side of the basin. You will see a thing."
Time passed.
Some of Hawat's men stirred, whispering.
"Remain silent as frightened animals," the Fremen hissed.
Hawat discerned movement near the opposite cliff--flitting blurs of tan on
tan.
"My little friend carried his message," the Fremen said. "He is a good
messenger--day or night. I'll be unhappy to lose that one."
The movement across the sink faded away. On the entire four to five
kilometer expanse of sand nothing remained but the growing pressure of the day's
heat--blurred columns of rising air.
"Be most silent now," the Fremen whispered.
A file of plodding figures emerged from a break in the opposite cliff,
headed directly across the sink. To Hawat, they appeared to be Fremen, but a
curiously inept band. He counted six men making heavy going of it over the
dunes.
A "thwok-thwok" of ornithopter wings sounded high to the right behind
Hawat's group. The craft came over the cliff wall above them--an Atreides
'thopter with Harkonnen battle colors splashed on it. The 'thopter swooped
toward the men crossing the sink.
The group there stopped on a dune crest, waved.
The 'thopter circled once over them in a tight curve, came back for a dustshrouded landing in front of the Fremen. Five men swarmed from the 'thopter and
Hawat saw the dust-repellent shimmering of shields and, in their motions, the
hard competence of Sardaukar.
"Aiihh! They use their stupid shields," the Fremen beside Hawat hissed. He
glanced toward the open south wall of the sink.
"They are Sardaukar," Hawat whispered.
"Good."
The Sardaukar approached the waiting group of Fremen in an enclosing halfcircle. Sun glinted on blades held ready. The Fremen stood in a compact group,
apparently indifferent.

Abruptly, the sand around the two groups sprouted Fremen. They were at the
ornithopter, then in it. Where the two groups had met at the dune crest, a dust
cloud partly obscured violent motion.
Presently, dust settled. Only Fremen remained standing.
"They left only three men in their 'thopter," the Fremen beside Hawat said.
"That was fortunate. I don't believe we had to damage the craft in taking it."
Behind Hawat, one of his men whispered: "Those were Sardaukar!"
"Did you notice how well they fought?" the Fremen asked.
Hawat took a deep breath. He smelled the burned dust around him, felt the
heat, the dryness. In a voice to match that dryness, he said: "Yes, they fought
well, indeed."
The captured 'thopter took off with a lurching flap of wings, angled upward
to the south in a steep, wing-tucked climb.
So these Fremen can handle 'thopters, too, Hawat thought.
On the distant dune, a Fremen waved a square of green cloth: once . . .
twice.
"More come!" the Fremen beside Hawat barked. "Be ready. I'd hoped to have us
away without more inconvenience."
Inconvenience! Hawat thought.
He saw two more 'thopters swooping from high in the west onto an area of
sand suddenly devoid of visible Fremen. Only eight splotches of blue--the bodies
of the Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniforms--remained at the scene of violence.
Another 'thopter glided in over the cliff wall above Hawat. He drew in a
sharp breath as he saw it--a big troop carrier. It flew with the slow, spreadwing heaviness of a full load--like a giant bird coming to its nest.
In the distance, the purple finger of a lasgun beam flicked from one of the
diving 'thopters. It laced across the sand, raising a sharp trail of dust.
"The cowards!" the Fremen beside Hawat rasped.
The troop carrier settled toward the patch of blue-clad bodies. Its wings
crept out to full reach, began the cupping action of a quick stop.
Hawat's attention was caught by a flash of sun on metal to the south, a
'thopter plummeting there in a power dive, wings folded flat against its sides,
its jets a golden flare against the dark silvered gray of the sky. It plunged
like an arrow toward the troop carrier which was unshielded because of the
lasgun activity around it. Straight into the carrier the diving 'thopter
plunged.
A flaming roar shook the basin. Rocks tumbled from the cliff walls all
around. A geyser of red-orange shot skyward from the sand where the carrier and
its companion 'thopters had been--everything there caught in the flame.
It was the Fremen who took off in that captured 'thopter, Hawat thought. He
deliberately sacrificed himself to get that carrier. Great Mother! What are
these Fremen?
"A reasonable exchange," said the Fremen beside Hawat. "There must've been
three hundred men in that carrier. Now, we must see to their water and make
plans to get another aircraft." He started to step out of their rock-shadowed
concealment.
A rain of blue uniforms came over the cliff wall in front of him, falling in
low-suspensor slowness. In the flashing instant, Hawat had time to see that they
were Sardaukar, hard faces set in battle frenzy, that they were unshielded and
each carried a knife in one hand, a stunner in the other.
A thrown knife caught Hawat's Fremen companion in the throat, hurting him
backward, twisting face down. Hawat had only time to draw his own knife before
blackness of a stunner projectile felled him.

-from "Arrakis Awakening" by the Princess Irulan
As the ornithopters glided out of the night above them, Paul grabbed his
mother's arm, snapped: "Don't move!"
Then he saw the lead craft in the moonlight, the way its wings cupped to
brake for landing, the reckless dash of the hands at the controls.
"It's Idaho," he breathed.
The craft and its companions settled into the basin like a covey of birds
coming to nest. Idaho was out of his 'thopter and running toward them before the
dust settled. Two figures in Fremen robes followed him. Paul recognized one: the
tall, sandy-bearded Kynes.
"This way!" Kynes called and he veered left.
Behind Kynes, other Fremen were throwing fabric covers over their
ornithopters. The craft became a row of shallow dunes.
Idaho skidded to a stop in front of Paul, saluted. "M'Lord, the Fremen have
a temporary hiding place nearby where we--"
"What about that back there?"
Paul pointed to the violence above the distant cliff--the jetflares, the
purple beams of lasguns lacing the desert.
A rare smile touched Idaho's round, placid face. "M'Lord . . . Sire, I've
left them a little sur--"
Glaring white light filled the desert--bright as a sun, etching their
shadows onto the rock floor of the ledge. In one sweeping motion, Idaho had
Paul's arm in one hand, Jessica's shoulder in the other, hurling them down off
the ledge into the basin. They sprawled together in the sand as the roar of an
explosion thundered over them. Its shock wave tumbled chips off the rock ledge
they had vacated.
Idaho sat up, brushed sand from himself.
"Not the family atomics!" Jessica said. "I thought--"
"You planted a shield back there," Paul said.
"A big one turned to full force," Idaho said. "A lasgun beam touched it and
. . . " He shrugged.
"Subatomic fusion," Jessica said. "That's a dangerous weapon."
"Not weapon, m'Lady, defense. That scum will think twice before using
lasguns another time."
The Fremen from the ornithopters stopped above them. One called in a low
voice: "We should get under cover, friends."
Paul got to his feet as Idaho helped Jessica up.
"That blast will attract considerable attention, Sire," Idaho said.
Sire, Paul thought.
The word had such a strange sound when directed at him. Sire had always been
his father.
He felt himself touched briefly by his powers of prescience, seeing himself
infected by the wild race consciousness that was moving the human universe
toward chaos. The vision left him shaken, and he allowed Idaho to guide him
along the edge of the basin to a rock projection. Fremen there were opening a
way down into the sand with their compaction tools.
"May I take your pack, Sire?" Idaho asked.

"It's not heavy, Duncan," Paul said.
"You have no body shield," Idaho said. "Do you wish mine?" He glanced at the
distant cliff. "Not likely there'll be any more lasgun activity about."
"Keep your shield, Duncan. Your right arm is shield enough for me."
Jessica saw the way the praise took effect, how Idaho moved closer to Paul,
and she thought: Such a sure hand my son has with his people.
The Fremen removed a rock plug that opened a passage down into the native
basement complex of the desert. A camouflage cover was rigged for the opening.
"This way," one of the Fremen said, and he led them down rock steps into
darkness.
Behind them, the cover blotted out the moonlight. A dim green glow came
alive ahead, revealing the steps and rock walls, a turn to the left. Robed
Fremen were all around them now, pressing downward. They rounded the corner,
found another down-slanting passage. It opened into a rough cave chamber.
Kynes stood before them, jubba hood thrown back. The neck of his stillsuit
glistening in the green light. His long hair and beard were mussed. The blue
eyes without whites were a darkness under heavy brows.
In the moment of encounter, Kynes wondered at himself: Why am I helping
these people? It's the most dangerous thing I've ever done. It could doom me
with them.
Then he looked squarely at Paul, seeing the boy who had taken on the mantle
of manhood, masking grief, suppressing all except the position that now must be
assumed--the dukedom. And Kynes realized in that moment the dukedom still
existed and solely because of this youth--and this was not a thing to be taken
lightly.
Jessica glanced once around the chamber, registering it on her senses in the
Bene Gesserit way--a laboratory, a civil place full of angles and squares in the
ancient manner.
"This is one of the Imperial Ecological Testing Stations my father wanted as
advance bases," Paul said.
His father wanted! Kynes thought.
And again Kynes wondered at himself. Am I foolish to aid these fugitives?
Why am I doing it? It'd be so easy to take them now, to buy the Harkonnen trust
with them.
Paul followed his mother's example, gestalting the room, seeing the
workbench down one side, the walls of featureless rock. Instruments lined the
bench--dials glowing, wire gridex planes with fluting glass emerging from them.
An ozone smell permeated the place.
Some of the Fremen moved on around a concealing angle in the chamber and new
sounds started there--machine coughs, the whinnies of spinning belts and
multidrives.
Paul looked to the end of the room, saw cages with small animals in them
stacked against the wall.
"You've recognized this place correctly," Kynes said. "For what would you
use such a place, Paul Atreides?"
"To make this planet a fit place for humans," Paul said.
Perhaps that's why I help them, Kynes thought.
The machine sounds abruptly hummed away to silence. Into this void there
came a thin animal squeak from the cages. It was cut off abruptly as though in
embarrassment.
Paul returned his attention to the cages, saw that the animals were brownwinged bats. An automatic feeder extended from the side wall across the cages.
A Fremen emerged from the hidden area of the chamber, spoke to Kynes: "Liet,
the field-generator equipment is not working. I am unable to mask us from
proximity detectors."
"Can you repair it?" Kynes asked.
"Not quickly. The parts . . . " The man shrugged.

"Yes," Kynes said. "Then we'll do without machinery. Get a hand pump for air
out to the surface."
"Immediately." The man hurried away.
Kynes turned back to Paul. "You gave a good answer."
Jessica marked the easy rumble of the man's voice. It was a royal voice,
accustomed to command. And she had not missed the reference to him as Liet. Liet
was the Fremen alter ego, the other face of the tame planetologist.
"We're most grateful for your help, Doctor Kynes," she said.
"Mm-m-m, we'll see," Kynes said. He nodded to one of his men. "Spice coffee
in my quarters, Shamir."
"At once, Liet," the man said.
Kynes indicated an arched opening in the side wall of the chamber. "If you
please?"
Jessica allowed herself a regal nod before accepting. She saw Paul give a
hand signal to Idaho, telling him to mount guard here.
The passage, two paces deep, opened through a heavy door into a square
office lighted by golden glowglobes. Jessica passed her hand across the door as
she entered, was startled to identify plasteel.
Paul stepped three paces into the room, dropped his pack to the floor. He
heard the door close behind him, studied the place--about eight meters to a
side, walls of natural rock, curry-colored, broken by metal filing cabinets on
their right. A low desk with milk glass top shot full of yellow bubbles occupied
the room's center. Four suspensor chairs ringed the desk.
Kynes moved around Paul, held a chair for Jessica. She sat down, noting the
way her son examined the room.
Paul remained standing for another eyeblink. A faint anomaly in the room's
air currents told him there was a secret exit to their right behind the filing
cabinets.
"Will you sit down, Paul Atreides?" Kynes asked.
How carefully he avoids my title, Paul thought. But he accepted the chair,
remained silent while Kynes sat down.
"You sense that Arrakis could be a paradise," Kynes said. "Yet, as you see,
the Imperium sends here only its trained hatchetmen, its seekers after the
spice!"
Paul held up his thumb with its ducal signet. "Do you see this ring?"
"Yes."
"Do you know its significance?"
Jessica turned sharply to stare at her son.
"Your father lies dead in the ruins of Arrakeen," Kynes said. "You are
technically the Duke."
"I'm a soldier of the Imperium," Paul said, "technically a hatchetman."
Kynes face darkened. "Even with the Emperor's Sardaukar standing over your
father's body?"
"The Sardaukar are one thing, the legal source of my authority is another,"
Paul said.
"Arrakis has its own way of determining who wears the mantle of authority,"
Kynes said.
And Jessica, turning back to look at him, thought: There's steel in this man
that no one has taken the temper out of . . . and we've need of steel. Paul's
doing a dangerous thing.
Paul said: "The Sardaukar on Arrakis are a measure of how much our beloved
Emperor feared my father. Now, I will give the Padishah Emperor reasons to fear
the--"
"Lad," Kynes said, "there are things you don't--"
"You will address me as Sire or my Lord," Paul said.
Gently, Jessica thought.

Kynes stared at Paul, and Jessica noted the glint of admiration in the
planetologist's face, the touch of humor there.
"Sire," Kynes said.
"I am an embarrassment to the Emperor," Paul said. "I am an embarrassment to
all who would divide Arrakis as their spoil. As I live, I shall continue to be
such an embarrassment that I stick in their throats and choke them to death!"
"Words," Kynes said.
Paul stared at him. Presently, Paul said: "You have a legend of the Lisan
al-Gaib here, the Voice from the Outer World, the one who will lead the Fremen
to paradise. Your men have--"
"Superstition!" Kynes said.
"Perhaps, "Paul agreed. "Yet perhaps not. Superstitions sometimes have
strange roots and stranger branchings."
"You have a plan," Kynes said. "This much is obvious . . . Sire."
"Could your Fremen provide me with proof positive that the Sardaukar are
here in Harkonnen uniform?"
"Quite likely."
"The Emperor will put a Harkonnen back in power here," Paul said. "Perhaps
even Beast Rabban. Let him. Once he has involved himself beyond escaping his
guilt, let the Emperor face the possibility of a Bill of Particulars laid before
the Landsraad. Let him answer there where--"
"Paul!" Jessica said.
"Granted that the Landsraad High Council accepts your case," Kynes said,
"there could be only one outcome: general warfare between the Imperium and the
Great Houses."
"Chaos," Jessica said.
"But I'd present my case to the Emperor," Paul said, "and give him an
alternative to chaos."
Jessica spoke in a dry tone: "Blackmail?"
"One of the tools of statecraft, as you've said yourself," Paul said, and
Jessica heard the bitterness in his voice. "The Emperor has no sons, only
daughters."
"You'd aim for the throne?" Jessica asked.
"The Emperor will not risk having the Imperium shattered by total war," Paul
said. "Planets blasted, disorder everywhere--he'll not risk that."
"This is a desperate gamble you propose," Kynes said.
"What do the Great Houses of the Landsraad fear most?" Paul asked. "They
fear most what is happening here right now on Arrakis--the Sardaukar picking
them off one by one. That's why there is a Landsraad. This is the glue of the
Great Convention. Only in union do they match the Imperial forces."
"But they're--"
"This is what they fear," Paul said. "Arrakis would become a rallying cry.
Each of them would see himself in my father--cut out of the herd and killed."
Kynes spoke to Jessica: "Would his plan work?"
"I'm no Mentat," Jessica said.
"But you are Bene Gesserit."
She shot a probing stare at him, said: "His plan has good points and bad
points . . . as any plan would at this stage. A plan depends as much upon
execution as it does upon concept."
" 'Law is the ultimate science,' " Paul quoted. "Thus it reads above the
Emperor's door. I propose to show him law."
"And I'm not sure I could trust the person who conceived this plan," Kynes
said. "Arrakis has its own plan that we--"
"From the throne," Paul said, "I could make a paradise of Arrakis with the
wave of a hand. This is the coin I offer for your support."
Kynes stiffened. "My loyalty's not for sale, Sire."
Paul stared across the desk at him, meeting the cold glare of those bluewithin-blue eyes, studying the bearded face, the commanding appearance. A harsh
smile touched Paul's lips and he said: "Well spoken. I apologize."
Kynes met Paul's stare and, presently, said: "No Harkonnen ever admitted
error. Perhaps you're not like them, Atreides."
"It could be a fault in their education," Paul said. "You say you're not for
sale, but I believe I've the coin you'll accept. For your loyalty I offer my
loyalty to you . . . totally."
My son has the Atreides sincerity, Jessica thought. He has that tremendous,
almost naive honor--and what a powerful force that truly is.
She saw that Paul's words had shaken Kynes.
"This is nonsense," Kynes said. "You're just a boy and--"
"I'm the Duke," Paul said. "I'm an Atreides. No Atreides has ever broken
such a bond."
Kynes swallowed.
"When I say totally," Paul said, "I mean without reservation. I would give
my life for you."
"Sire!" Kynes said, and the word was torn from him, but Jessica saw that he
was not now speaking to a boy of fifteen, but to a man, to a superior. Now Kynes
meant the word.
In this moment he'd give his life for Paul, she thought. How do the Atreides
accomplish this thing so quickly, so easily?
"I know you mean this," Kynes said. "Yet the Harkon--"
The door behind Paul slammed open. He whirled to see reeling violence-shouting, the clash of steel, wax-image faces grimacing in the passage.
With his mother beside him, Paul leaped for the door, seeing Idaho blocking
the passage, his blood-pitted eyes there visible through a shield blur, claw
hands beyond him, arcs of steel chopping futilely at the shield. There was the
orange fire-mouth of a stunner repelled by the shield. Idaho's blades were
through it all, flick-flicking, red dripping from them.
Then Kynes was beside Paul and they threw their weight against the door.
Paul had one last glimpse of Idaho standing against a swarm of Harkonnen
uniforms--his jerking, controlled staggers, the black goat hair with a red
blossom of death in it. Then the door was closed and there came a snick as Kynes
threw the bolts.
"I appear to've decided," Kynes said.
"Someone detected your machinery before it was shut down," Paul said. He
pulled his mother away from the door, met the despair in her eyes.
"I should've suspected trouble when the coffee failed to arrive," Kynes
said.
"You've a bolt hole out of here," Paul said. "Shall we use it?"
Kynes took a deep breath, said: "This door should hold for at least twenty
minutes against all but a lasgun."
"They'll not use a lasgun for fear we've shields on this side," Paul said.
"Those were Sardaukar in Harkonnen uniform," Jessica whispered.
They could hear pounding on the door now, rhythmic blows.
Kynes indicated the cabinets against the right-hand wall, said: "This way."
He crossed to the first cabinet, opened a drawer, manipulated a handle within
it. The entire wall of cabinets swung open to expose the black mouth of a
tunnel. "This door also is plasteel," Kynes said.
"You were well prepared," Jessica said.
"We lived under the Harkonnens for eighty years," Kynes said. He herded them
into the darkness, closed the door.
In the sudden blackness, Jessica saw a luminous arrow on the floor ahead of
her.
Kynes' voice came from behind them: "We'll separate here. This wall is
tougher. It'll stand for at least an hour. Follow the arrows like that one on
the floor. They'll be extinguished by your passage. They lead through a maze to
another exit where I've secreted a 'thopter. There's a storm across the desert
tonight. Your only hope is to run for that storm, dive into the top of it, ride
with it. My people have done this in stealing 'thopters. If you stay high in the
storm you'll survive."
"What of you?" Paul asked.
"I'll try to escape another way. If I'm captured . . . well, I'm still
Imperial Planetologist. I can say I was your captive."
Running like cowards, Paul thought. But how else can I live to avenge my
father? He turned to face the door.
Jessica heard him move, said "Duncan's dead, Paul. You saw the wound. You
can do nothing for him."
"I'll take full payment for them all one day," Paul said.
"Not unless you hurry now," Kynes said.
Paul felt the man's hand on his shoulder.
"Where will we meet, Kynes?" Paul asked.
"I'll send Fremen searching for you. The storm's path is known. Hurry now,
and the Great Mother give you speed and luck."
They heard him go, a scrambling in the blackness.
Jessica found Paul's hand, pulled him gently. "We must not get separated,"
she said.
"Yes."
He followed her across the first arrow, seeing it go black as they touched
it. Another arrow beckoned ahead.
They crossed it, saw it extinguish itself, saw another arrow ahead.
They were running now.
Plans within plans within plans within plans, Jessica thought. Have we
become part of someone else's plan now?
The arrows led them around turnings, past side openings only dimly sensed in
the faint luminescence. Their way slanted downward for a time, then up, ever up.
They came finally to steps, rounded a corner and were brought short by a glowing
wall with a dark handle visible in its center.
Paul pressed the handle.
The wall swung away from them. Light flared to reveal a rock-hewn cavern
with an ornithopter squatting in its center. A flat gray wall with a doorsign on
it loomed beyond the aircraft.
"Where did Kynes go?" Jessica asked.
"He did what any good guerrilla leader would," Paul said. "He separated us
into two parties and arranged that he couldn't reveal where we are if he's
captured. He won't really know."
Paul drew her into the room, noting how their feet kicked up dust on the
floor.
"No one's been here for a long time," he said.
"He seemed confident the Fremen could find us," she said.
"I share that confidence."
Paul released her hand, crossed to the ornithopter's left door, opened it,
and secured his pack in the rear. "This ship's proximity masked," he said.
"Instrument panel has remote door control, light control. Eighty years under the
Harkonnens taught them to be thorough."
Jessica leaned against the craft's other side, catching her breath.
"The Harkonnens will have a covering force over this area," she said.
"They're not stupid." She considered her direction sense, pointed right. "The
storm we saw is that way."
Paul nodded, fighting an abrupt reluctance to move. He knew its cause, but
found no help in the knowledge. Somewhere this night he had passed a decisionnexus into the deep unknown. He knew the time-area surrounding them, but the
here-and-now existed as a place of mystery. It was as though he had seen himself
from a distance go out of sight down into a valley. Of the countless paths up
out of that valley, some might carry a Paul Atreides back into sight, but many
would not.
"The longer we wait the better prepared they'll be," Jessica said.
"Get in and strap yourself down," he said.
He joined her in the ornithopter, still wrestling with the thought that this
was blind ground, unseen in any prescient vision. And he realized with an abrupt
sense of shock that he had been giving more and more reliance to prescient
memory and it had weakened him for this particular emergency.
"If you rely only on your eyes, your other senses weaken." It was a Bene
Gesserit axiom. He took it to himself now, promising never again to fall into
that trap . . . if he lived through this.
Paul fastened his safety harness, saw that his mother was secure, checked
the aircraft. The wings were at full spread-rest, their delicate metal
interleavings extended. He touched the retractor bar, watched the wings shorten
for jet-boost take-off the way Gurney Halleck had taught him. The starter switch
moved easily. Dials on the instrument panel came alive as the jetpods were
armed. Turbines began their low hissing.
"Ready?" he asked.
"Yes."
He touched the remote control for lights.
Darkness blanketed them.
His hand was a shadow against the luminous dials as he tripped the remote
door control. Grating sounded ahead of them. A cascade of sand swished away to
silence. A dusty breeze touched Paul's cheeks. He closed his door, feeling the
sudden pressure.
A wide patch of dust-blurred stars framed in angular darkness appeared where
the door-wall had been. Starlight defined a shelf beyond, a suggestion of sand
ripples.
Paul depressed the glowing action-sequence switch on his panel. The wings
snapped back and down, hurling the 'thopter out of its nest. Power surged from
the jetpods as the wings locked into lift attitude.
Jessica let her hands ride lightly on the dual controls, feeling the
sureness of her son's movements. She was frightened, yet exhilarated. Now,
Paul's training is our only hope, she thought. His youth and swiftness.
Paul fed more power to the jetpods. The 'thopter banked, sinking them into
their seats as a dark wall lifted against the stars ahead. He gave the craft
more wing, more power. Another burst of lifting wingbeats and they came out over
rocks, silver-frosted angles and outcroppings in the starlight. The dustreddened second moon showed itself above the horizon to their right, defining
the ribbon trail of the storm.
Paul's hands danced over the controls. Wings snicked in to beetle stubs. Gforce pulled at their flesh as the craft came around in a tight bank.
"Jetflares behind us!" Jessica said.
"I saw them."
He slammed the power arm forward.
Their 'thopter leaped like a frightened animal, surged southwest toward the
storm and the great curve of desert. In the near distance, Paul saw scattered
shadows telling where the line of rocks ended, the basement complex sinking
beneath the dunes. Beyond stretched moonlit fingernail shadows--dunes
diminishing one into another.
And above the horizon climbed the flat immensity of the storm like a wall
against the stars.
Something jarred the 'thopter.
"Shellburst!" Jessica gasped. "They're using some kind of projectile
weapon."
She saw a sudden animal grin on Paul's face. "They seem to be avoiding their
lasguns," he said.
"But we've no shields!"
"Do they know that?"
Again the 'thopter shuddered.
Paul twisted to peer back. "Only one of them appears to be fast enough to
keep up with us."
He returned his attention to their course, watching the storm wall grow high
in front of them. It loomed like a tangible solid.
"Projectile launchers, rockets, all the ancient weaponry--that's one thing
we'll give the Fremen," Paul whispered.
"The storm," Jessica said. "Hadn't you better turn?"
"What about the ship behind us?"
"He's pulling up."
"Now!"
Paul stubbed the wings, banked hard left into the deceptively slow boiling
of the storm wall, felt his cheeks pull in the G-force.
They appeared to glide into a slow clouding of dust that grew heavier and
heavier until it blotted out the desert and the moon. The aircraft became a
long, horizontal whisper of darkness lighted only by the green luminosity of the
instrument panel.
Through Jessica's mind flashed all the warnings about such storms--that they
cut metal like butter, etched flesh to bone and ate away the bones. She felt the
buffeting of dust-blanketed wind. It twisted them as Paul fought the controls.
She saw him chop the power, felt the ship buck. The metal around them hissed and
trembled.
"Sand!" Jessica shouted.
She saw the negative shake of his head in the light from the panel. "Not
much sand this high."
But she could feel them sinking deeper into the maelstrom.
Paul sent the wings to their full soaring length, heard them creak with the
strain. He kept his eyes fixed on the instruments, gliding by instinct, fighting
for altitude.
The sound of their passage diminished.
The 'thopter began rolling off to the left. Paul focused on the glowing
globe within the attitude curve, fought his craft back to level flight.
Jessica had the eerie feeling that they were standing still, that all motion
was external. A vague tan flowing against the windows, a rumbling hiss reminded
her of the powers around them.
Winds to seven or eight hundred kilometers an hour, she thought. Adrenaline
edginess gnawed at her. I must not fear, she told herself, mouthing the words of
the Bene Gesserit litany. Fear is the mind-killer.
Slowly her long years of training prevailed.
Calmness returned.
"We have the tiger by the tail," Paul whispered. "We can't go down, can't
land . . . and I don't think I can lift us out of this. We'll have to ride it
out."
Calmness drained out of her. Jessica felt her teeth chattering, clamped them
together. Then she heard Paul's voice, low and controlled, reciting the litany:
"Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little death that brings total
obliteration. I will face my fear. I will permit it to pass over me and through
me. And when it has gone past me I will turn to see fear's path. Where the fear
has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain."

-from "Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
"They are dead, Baron," said Iakin Nefud, the guard captain. "Both the woman
and the boy are certainly dead."
The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen sat up in the sleep suspensors of his private
quarters. Beyond these quarters and enclosing him like a multishelled egg
stretched the space frigate he had grounded on Arrakis. Here in his quarters,
though, the ship's harsh metal was disguised with draperies, with fabric
paddings and rare art objects.
"It is a certainty," the guard captain said. "They are dead."
The Baron shifted his gross body in the suspensors, focused his attention on
an ebaline statue of a leaping boy in a niche across the room. Sleep faded from
him. He straightened the padded suspensor beneath the fat folds of his neck,
stared across the single glowglobe of his bedchamber to the doorway where
Captain Nefud stood blocked by the pentashield.
"They're certainly dead, Baron," the man repeated.
The Baron noted the trace of semuta dullness in Nefud's eyes. It was obvious
the man had been deep within the drug's rapture when he received this report,
and had stopped only to take the antidote before rushing here.
"I have a full report," Nefud said.
Let him sweat a little, the Baron thought. One must always keep the tools of
statecraft sharp and ready. Power and fear--sharp and ready.
"Have you seen their bodies?" the Baron rumbled.
Nefud hesitated.
"Well?"
"M'Lord . . . they were seen to dive into a sandstorm . . . winds over eight
hundred kilometers. Nothing survives such a storm, m'Lord. Nothing! One of our
own craft was destroyed in the pursuit."
The Baron stared at Nefud, noting the nervous twitch in the scissors line of
the man's jaw muscles, the way the chin moved as Nefud swallowed.
"You have seen the bodies?" the Baron asked.
"M'Lord--"
"For what purpose do you come here rattling your armor?" the Baron roared.
"To tell me a thing is certain when it is not? Do you think I'll praise you for
such stupidity, give you another promotion?"
Nefud's face went bone pale.
Look at the chicken, the Baron thought. I am surrounded by such useless
clods. If I scattered sand before this creature and told him it was grain, he'd
peek at it.
"The man Idaho led us to them, then?" the Baron asked.
"Yes, m'Lord!"
Look how he blurts out his answer, the Baron thought. He said: "They were
attempting to flee to the Fremen, eh?"
"Yes, m'Lord."
"Is there more to this . . . report?"
"The Imperial Planetologist, Kynes, is involved, m'Lord. Idaho joined this
Kynes under mysterious circumstances . . . I might even say suspicious
circumstances."
"So?"
"They . . . ah, fled together to a place in the desert where it's apparent
the boy and his mother were hiding. In the excitement of the chase, several of
our groups were caught in a lasgun-shield explosion."
"How many did we lose?"
"I'm . . . ah, not sure yet, m'Lord."
He's lying, the Baron thought. It must've been pretty bad.
"The Imperial lackey, this Kynes," the Baron said. "He was playing a double
game, eh?"
"I'd stake my reputation on it, m'Lord."
His reputation!
"Have the man killed," the Baron said.
"M'Lord! Kynes is the Imperial Planetologist, His Majesty's own serv--"
"Make it look like an accident, then!"
"M'Lord, there were Sardaukar with our forces in the subjugation of this
Fremen nest. They have Kynes in custody now."
"Get him away from them. Say I wish to question him."
"If they demur?"
"They will not if you handle it correctly."
Nefud swallowed. "Yes, m'Lord."
"The man must die," the Baron rumbled. "He tried to help my enemies."
Nefud shifted from one foot to the other.
"Well?"
"M'Lord, the Sardaukar have . . . two persons in custody who might be of
interest to you. They've caught the Duke's Master of Assassins."
"Hawat? Thufir Hawat?"
"I've seen the captive myself, m'Lord. 'Tis Hawat."
"I'd not've believed it possible!"
"They say he was knocked out by a stunner, m'Lord. In the desert where he
couldn't use his shield. He's virtually unharmed. If we can get our hands on
him, he'll provide great sport."
"This is a Mentat you speak of," the Baron growled. "One doesn't waste a
Mentat. Has he spoken? What does he say of his defeat? Could he know the extent
of . . . but no."
"He has spoken only enough, m'Lord, to reveal his belief that the Lady
Jessica was his betrayer."
"Ah-h-h-h-h."
The Baron sank back, thinking; then: "You're sure? It's the Lady Jessica who
attracts his anger?"
"He said it in my presence, m'Lord."
"Let him think she's alive, then."
"But, m'Lord--"
"Be quiet. I wish Hawat treated kindly. He must be told nothing of the late
Doctor Yueh, his true betrayer. Let it be said that Doctor Yueh died defending
his Duke. In a way, this may even be true. We will, instead, feed his suspicions
against the Lady Jessica."
"M'Lord, I don't--"
"The way to control and direct a Mentat, Nefud, is through his information.
False information--false results."
"Yes, m'Lord, but . . . "
"Is Hawat hungry? Thirsty?"
"M'Lord, Hawat's still in the hands of the Sardaukar!"
"Yes. Indeed, yes. But the Sardaukar will be as anxious to get information
from Hawat as I am. I've noticed a thing about our allies, Nefud. They're not
very devious . . .politically. I do believe this is a deliberate thing; the
Emperor wants it that way. Yes. I do believe it. You will remind the Sardaukar
commander of my renown at obtaining information from reluctant subjects."
Nefud looked unhappy. "Yes, m'Lord."
"You will tell the Sardaukar commander that I wish to question both Hawat
and this Kynes at the same time, playing one off against the other. He can
understand that much, I think."
"Yes, m'Lord."
"And once we have them in our hands . . . " The Baron nodded.
"M'Lord, the Sardaukar will want an observer with you during any . . .
questioning."
"I'm sure we can produce an emergency to draw off any unwanted observers,
Nefud."
"I understand, m'Lord. That's when Kynes can have his accident."
"Both Kynes and Hawat will have accidents then, Nefud. But only Kynes will
have a real accident. It's Hawat I want. Yes. Ah, yes."
Nefud blinked, swallowed. He appeared about to ask a question, but remained
silent.
"Hawat will be given both food and drink," the Baron said. "Treated with
kindness, with sympathy. In his water you will administer the residual poison
developed by the late Piter de Vries. And you will see that the antidote becomes
a regular part of Hawat's diet from this point on . . . unless I say otherwise."
"The antidote, yes." Nefud shook his head. "But--"
"Don't be dense, Nefud. The Duke almost killed me with that poison-capsule
tooth. The gas he exhaled into my presence deprived me of my most valuable
Mentat, Piter. I need a replacement."
"Hawat?"
"Hawat."
"But--"
"You're going to say Hawat's completely loyal to the Atreides. True, but the
Atreides are dead. We will woo him. He must be convinced he's not to blame for
the Duke's demise. It was all the doing of that Bene Gesserit witch. He had an
inferior master, one whose reason was clouded by emotion. Mentats admire the
ability to calculate without emotion, Nefud. We will woo the formidable Thufir
Hawat."
"Woo him. Yes, m'Lord."
"Hawat, unfortunately, had a master whose resources were poor, one who could
not elevate a Mentat to the sublime peaks of reasoning that are a Mentat's
right. Hawat will see a certain element of truth in this. The Duke couldn't
afford the most efficient spies to provide his Mentat with the required
information." The Baron stared at Nefud. "Let us never deceive ourselves, Nefud.
The truth is a powerful weapon. We know how we overwhelmed the Atreides. Hawat
knows, too. We did it with wealth."
"With wealth. Yes, m'Lord."
"We will woo Hawat," the Baron said. "We will hide him from the Sardaukar.
And we will hold in reserve . . . the withdrawal of the antidote for the poison.
There's no way of removing the residual poison. And, Nefud, Hawat need never
suspect. The antidote will not betray itself to a poison snooper. Hawat can scan
his food as he pleases and detect no trace of poison."
Nefud's eyes opened wide with understanding.
"The absence of a thing," the Baron said, "this can be as deadly as the
presence. The absence of air, eh? The absence of water? The absence of anything
else we're addicted to." The Baron nodded. "You understand me, Nefud?"
Nefud swallowed. "Yes, m'Lord."
Then get busy. Find the Sardaukar commander and set things in motion."
"At once, m'Lord." Nefud bowed, turned, and hurried away.
Hawat by my side! the Baron thought. The Sardaukar will give him to me. If
they suspect anything at all it's that I wish to destroy the Mentat. And this
suspicion I'll confirm! The fools! One of the most formidable Mentats in all
history, a Mentat trained to kill, and they'll toss him to me like some silly
toy to be broken. I will show them what use can be made of such a toy.
The Baron reached beneath a drapery beside his suspensor bed, pressed a
button to summon his older nephew, Rabban. He sat back, smiling.
And all the Atreides dead!
The stupid guard captain had been right, of course. Certainly, nothing
survived in the path of a sandblast storm on Arrakis. Not an ornithopter . . .
or its occupants. The woman and the boy were dead. The bribes in the right
places, the unthinkable expenditure to bring overwhelming military force down
onto one planet . . . all the sly reports tailored for the Emperor's ears alone,
all the careful scheming were here at last coming to full fruition.
Power and fear--fear and power!
The Baron could see the path ahead of him. One day, a Harkonnen would be
Emperor. Not himself, and no spawn of his loins. But a Harkonnen. Not this
Rabban he'd summoned, of course. But Rabban's younger brother, young FeydRautha. There was a sharpness to the boy that the Baron enjoyed . . . a
ferocity.
A lovely boy, the Baron thought. A year or two more--say, by the time he's
seventeen, I'll know for certain whether he's the tool that House Harkonnen
requires to gain the throne.
"M'Lord Baron."
The man who stood outside the doorfield of the Baron's bedchamber was low
built, gross of face and body, with the Harkonnen paternal line's narrow-set
eyes and bulge of shoulders. There was yet some rigidity in his fat, but it was
obvious to the eye that he'd come one day to the portable suspensors for
carrying his excess weight.
A muscle-minded tank-brain, the Baron thought. No Mentat, my nephew . . .
not a Piter de Vries, but perhaps something more precisely devised for the task
at hand. If I give him freedom to do it, he'll grind over everything in his
path. Oh, how he'll be hated here on Arrakis!
"My dear Rabban," the Baron said. He released the doorfield, but pointedly
kept his body shield at full strength, knowing that the shimmer of it would be
visible above the bedside glowglobe.
"You summoned me," Rabban said. He stepped into the room, flicked a glance
past the air disturbance of the body shield, searched for a suspensor chair,
found none.
"Stand closer where I can see you easily," the Baron said.
Rabban advanced another step, thinking that the damnable old man had
deliberately removed all chairs, forcing a visitor to stand.
"The Atreides are dead," the Baron said. "The last of them. That's why I
summoned you here to Arrakis. This planet is again yours."
Rabban blinked. "But I thought you were going to advance Piter de Vries to
the--"
"Piter, too, is dead."
"Piter?"
"Piter."
The Baron reactivated the doorfield, blanked it against all energy
penetration.
"You finally tired of him, eh?" Rabban asked.
His voice fell flat and lifeless in the energy-blanketed room.
"I will say a thing to you just this once," the Baron rumbled. "You
insinuate that I obliterated Piter as one obliterates a trifle." He snapped fat
fingers. "Just like that, eh? I am not so stupid, Nephew. I will take it
unkindly if ever again you suggest by word or action that I am so stupid."
Fear showed in the squinting of Rabban's eyes. He knew within certain limits
how far the old Baron would go against family. Seldom to the point of death
unless there were outrageous profit or provocation in it. But family punishments
could be painful.
"Forgive me, m'Lord Baron," Rabban said. He lowered his eyes as much to hide
his own anger as to show subservience.
"You do not fool me, Rabban," the Baron said.
Rabban kept his eyes lowered, swallowed.
"I make a point," the Baron said. "Never obliterate a man unthinkingly, the
way an entire fief might do it through some due process of law. Always do it for
an overriding purpose--and know your purpose!"
Anger spoke in Rabban: "But you obliterated the traitor, Yueh! I saw his
body being carried out as I arrived last night."
Rabban stared at his uncle, suddenly frightened by the sound of those words.
But the Baron smiled. "I'm very careful about dangerous weapons," he said.
"Doctor Yueh was a traitor. He gave me the Duke." Strength poured into the
Baron's voice. "I suborned a doctor of the Suk School! The Inner School! You
hear, boy? But that's a wild sort of weapon to leave lying about. I didn't
obliterate him casually."
"Does the Emperor know you suborned a Suk doctor?"
This was a penetrating question, the Baron thought. Have I misjudged this
nephew?
"The Emperor doesn't know it yet," the Baron said. "But his Sardaukar are
sure to report it to him. Before that happens, though, I'll have my own report
in his hands through CHOAM Company channels. I will explain that I luckily
discovered a doctor who pretended to the conditioning. A false doctor, you
understand? Since everyone knows you cannot counter the conditioning of a Suk
School, this will be accepted."
"Ah-h-h, I see," Rabban murmured.
And the Baron thought: Indeed, I hope you do see. I hope you do see how
vital it is that this remain secret. The Baron suddenly wondered at himself. Why
did I do that? Why did I boast to this fool nephew of mine--the nephew I must
use and discard? The Baron felt anger at himself. He felt betrayed.
"It must be kept secret," Rabban said. "I understand."
The Baron sighed. "I give you different instructions about Arrakis this
time, Nephew. When last you ruled this place, I held you in strong rein. This
time, I have only one requirement."
"M'Lord?"
"Income."
"Income?"
"Have you any idea, Rabban, how much we spent to bring such military force
to bear on the Atreides? Do you have even the first inkling of how much the
Guild charges for military transport?"
"Expensive, eh?"
"Expensive!"
The Baron shot a fat arm toward Rabban. "If you squeeze Arrakis for every
cent it can give us for sixty years, you'll just barely repay us!"
Rabban opened his mouth, closed it without speaking.
"Expensive," the Baron sneered. "The damnable Guild monopoly on space
would've ruined us if I hadn't planned for this expense long ago. You should
know, Rabban, that we bore the entire brunt of it. We even paid for transport of
the Sardaukar."
And not for the first time, the Baron wondered if there ever would come a
day when the Guild might be circumvented. They were insidious--bleeding off just
enough to keep the host from objecting until they had you in their fist where
they could force you to pay and pay and pay.
Always, the exorbitant demands rode upon military ventures. "Hazard rates,"
the oily Guild agents explained. And for every agent you managed to insert as a
watchdog in the Guild Bank structure, they put two agents into your system.
Insufferable!
"Income then," Rabban said.
The Baron lowered his arm, made a fist. "You must squeeze."
"And I may do anything I wish as long as I squeeze?"
"Anything."
"The cannons you brought," Rabban said. "Could I--"
"I'm removing them," the Baron said.
"But you--"
"You won't need such toys. They were a special innovation and are now
useless. We need the metal. They cannot go against a shield, Rabban. They were
merely the unexpected. It was predictable that the Duke's men would retreat into
cliff caves on this abominable planet. Our cannon merely sealed them in."
"The Fremen don't use shields."
"You may keep some lasguns if you wish."
"Yes, m 'Lord. And I have a free hand."
"As long as you squeeze."
Rabban's smile was gloating. "I understand perfectly, m'Lord."
"You understand nothing perfectly," the Baron growled. "Let us have that
clear at the outset. What you do understand is how to carry out my orders. Has
it occurred to you, nephew, that there are at least five million persons on this
planet?"
"Does m'Lord forget that I was his regent-siridar here before? And if m'Lord
will forgive me, his estimate may be low. It's difficult to count a population
scattered among sinks and pans the way they are here. And when you consider the
Fremen of--"
"The Fremen aren't worth considering!"
"Forgive me, m'Lord, but the Sardaukar believe otherwise."
The Baron hesitated, staring at his nephew. "You know something?"
"M'Lord had retired when I arrived last night. I . . . ah, took the liberty
of contacting some of my lieutenants from . . . ah, before. They've been acting
as guides to the Sardaukar. They report that a Fremen band ambushed a Sardaukar
force somewhere southeast of here and wiped it out."
"Wiped out a Sardaukar force?"
"Yes, m'Lord."
"Impossible!"
Rabban shrugged.
"Fremen defeating Sardaukar," the Baron sneered.
"I repeat only what was reported to me," Rabban said. "It is said this
Fremen force already had captured the Duke's redoubtable Thufir Hawat."
"Ah-h-h-h-h-h."
The Baron nodded, smiling.
"I believe the report," Rabban said. "You've no idea what a problem the
Fremen were."
"Perhaps, but these weren't Fremen your lieutenants saw. They must've been
Atreides men trained by Hawat and disguised as Fremen. It's the only possible
answer."
Again, Rabban shrugged. "Well, the Sardaukar think they were Fremen. The
Sardaukar already have launched a program to wipe out all Fremen."
"Good!"
"But--"
"It'll keep the Sardaukar occupied. And we'll soon have Hawat. I know it! I
can feel it! Ah, this has been a day! The Sardaukar off hunting a few useless
desert bands while we get the real prize!"
"M'Lord . . . " Rabban hesitated, frowning. "I've always felt that we
underestimated the Fremen, both in numbers and in--"
"Ignore them, boy! They're rabble. It's the populous towns, cities, and
villages that concern us. A great many people there, eh?"
"A great many, m'Lord."
"They worry me, Rabban."
"Worry you?"
"Oh . . . ninety per cent of them are of no concern. But there are always a
few . . . Houses Minor and so on, people of ambition who might try a dangerous
thing. If one of them should get off Arrakis with an unpleasant story about what
happened here, I'd be most displeased. Have you any idea how displeased I'd be?"
Rabban swallowed.

"You must take immediate measures to hold a hostage from each House Minor,"
the Baron said. "As far as anyone off Arrakis must learn, this was
straightforward House-to-House battle. The Sardaukar had no part in it, you
understand? The Duke was offered the usual quarter and exile, but he died in an
unfortunate accident before he could accept. He was about to accept, though.
That is the story. And any rumor that there were Sardaukar here, it must be
laughed at."
"As the Emperor wishes it," Rabban said.
"As the Emperor wishes it."
"What about the smugglers?"
"No one believes smugglers, Rabban. They are tolerated, but not believed. At
any rate, you'll be spreading some bribes in that quarter . . . and taking other
measures which I'm sure you can think of."
"Yes, m'Lord."
"Two things from Arrakis, then, Rabban: income and a merciless fist. You
must show no mercy here. Think of these clods as what they are--slaves envious
of their masters and waiting only the opportunity to rebel. Not the slightest
vestige of pity or mercy must you show them."
"Can one exterminate an entire planet?" Rabban asked.
"Exterminate?" Surprise showed in the swift turning of the Baron's head.
"Who said anything about exterminating?"
"Well, I presumed you were going to bring in new stock and--"
"I said squeeze. Nephew, not exterminate. Don't waste the population, merely
drive them into utter submission. You must be the carnivore, my boy." He smiled,
a baby's expression in the dimple-fat face. "A carnivore never stops. Show no
mercy. Never stop. Mercy is a chimera. It can be defeated by the stomach
rumbling its hunger, by the throat crying its thirst. You must be always hungry
and thirsty." The Baron caressed his bulges beneath the suspensors. "Like me."
"I see, m'Lord."
Rabban swung his gaze left and right.
"It's all clear then, Nephew?"
"Except for one thing. Uncle: the planetologist, Kynes."
"Ah, yes, Kynes."
"He's the Emperor's man, m'Lord. He can come and go as he pleases. And he's
very close to the Fremen . . . married one."
"Kynes will be dead by tomorrow's nightfall."
"That's dangerous work, Uncle, killing an Imperial servant."
"How do you think I've come this far this quickly?" the Baron demanded. His
voice was low, charged with unspeakable adjectives. "Besides, you need never
have feared Kynes would leave Arrakis. You're forgetting that he's addicted to
the spice."
"Of course!"
"Those who know will do nothing to endanger their supply," the Baron said.
"Kynes certainly must know."
"I forgot, "Rabban said.
They stared at each other in silence.
Presently, the Baron said: "Incidentally, you will make my own supply one of
your first concerns. I've quite a stockpile of private stuff, but that suicide
raid by the Duke's men got most of what we'd stored for sale."
Rabban nodded. "Yes, m'Lord."
The Baron brightened. "Now, tomorrow morning, you will assemble what remains
of organization here and you'll say to them: 'Our Sublime Padishah Emperor has
charged me to take possession of this planet and end all dispute.' "
"I understand, m'Lord."
"This time, I'm sure you do. We will discuss it in more detail tomorrow.
Now, leave me to finish my sleep."
The Baron deactivated his doorfield, watched his nephew out of sight.

A tank-brain, the Baron thought. Muscle-minded tank-brain. They will be
bloody pulp here when he's through with them. Then, when I send in Feyd-Rautha
to take the load off them, they'll cheer their rescuer. Beloved Feyd-Rautha.
Benign Feyd-Rautha, the compassionate one who saves them from a beast. FeydRautha, a man to follow and die for. The boy will know by that time how to
oppress with impunity. I'm sure he's the one we need. He'll learn. And such a
lovely body. Really a lovely boy.

-from "A Child's History of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
As Paul fought the 'thopter's controls, he grew aware that he was sorting
out the interwoven storm forces, his more than Mentat awareness computing on the
basis of fractional minutiae. He felt dust fronts, billowings, mixings of
turbulence, an occasional vortex.
The cabin interior was an angry box lighted by the green radiance of
instrument dials. The tan flow of dust outside appeared featureless, but his
inner sense began to see through the curtain.
I must find the right vortex, he thought.
For a long time now he had sensed the storm's power diminishing, but still
it shook them. He waited out another turbulence.
The vortex began as an abrupt billowing that rattled the entire ship. Paul
defied all fear to bank the 'thopter left.
Jessica saw the maneuver on the attitude globe.
"Paul!" she screamed.
The vortex turned them, twisting, tipping. It lifted the 'thopter like a
chip on a geyser, spewed them up and out--a winged speck within a core of
winding dust lighted by the second moon.
Paul looked down, saw the dust-defined pillar of hot wind that had disgorged
them, saw the dying storm trailing away like a dry river into the desert--moongray motion growing smaller and smaller below as they rode the updraft.
"We're out of it," Jessica whispered.
Paul turned their craft away from the dust in swooping rhythm while he
scanned the night sky.
"We've given them the slip," he said.
Jessica felt her heart pounding. She forced herself to calmness, looked at
the diminishing storm. Her time sense said they had ridden within that
compounding of elemental forces almost four hours, but part of her mind computed
the passage as a lifetime. She felt reborn.
It was like the litany, she thought. We faced it and did not resist. The
storm passed through us and around us. It's gone, but we remain.
"I don't like the sound of our wing motion," Paul said. "We suffered some
damage in there."
He felt the grating, injured flight through his hands on the controls. They
were out of the storm, but still not out into the full view of his prescient
vision. Yet, they had escaped, and Paul sensed himself trembling on the verge of
a revelation.
He shivered.
The sensation was magnetic and terrifying, and he found himself caught on
the question of what caused this trembling awareness. Part of it, he felt, was
the spice-saturated diet of Arrakis. But he thought part of it could be the
litany, as though the words had a power of their own.
"I shall not fear . . . "
Cause and effect: he was alive despite malignant forces, and he felt himself
poised on a brink of self-awareness that could not have been without the
litany's magic.
Words from the Orange Catholic Bible rang through his memory: "What senses
do we lack that we cannot see or hear another world all around us?"
"There's rock all around," Jessica said.
Paul focused on the 'thopter's launching, shook his head to clear it. He
looked where his mother pointed, saw uplifting rock shapes black on the sand
ahead and to the right. He felt wind around his ankles, a stirring of dust in
the cabin. There was a hole somewhere, more of the storm's doing.
"Better set us down on sand," Jessica said. "The wings might not take full
brake."
He nodded toward a place ahead where sandblasted ridges lifted into
moonlight above the dunes. "I'll set us down near those rocks. Check your safety
harness."
She obeyed, thinking: We've water and stillsuits. If we can find food, we
can survive a long time on this desert. Fremen live here. What they can do we
can do.
"Run for those rocks the instant we're stopped," Paul said. "I'll take the
pack."
"Run for . . . " She fell silent, nodded. "Worms."
"Our friends, the worms," he corrected her. "They'll get this 'thopter.
There'll be no evidence of where we landed."
How direct his thinking, she thought.
They glided lower . . . lower . . .
There came a rushing sense of motion to their passage--blurred shadows of
dunes, rocks lifting like islands. The 'thopter touched a dune top with a soft
lurch, skipped a sand valley, touched another dune.
He's killing our speed against the sand, Jessica thought, and permitted
herself to admire his competence.
"Brace yourself!" Paul warned.
He pulled back on the wing brakes, gently at first, then harder and harder.
He felt them cup the air, their aspect ratio dropping faster and faster. Wind
screamed through the lapped coverts and primaries of the wings' leaves.
Abruptly, with only the faintest lurch of warning, the left wing, weakened
by the storm, twisted upward and in, slamming across the side of the 'thopter.
The craft skidded across a dune top, twisting to the left. It tumbled down the
opposite face to bury its nose in the next dune amid a cascade of sand. They lay
stopped on the broken wing side, the right wing pointing toward the stars.
Paul jerked off his safety harness, hurled himself upward across his mother,
wrenching the door open. Sand poured around them into the cabin, bringing a dry
smell of burned flint. He grabbed the pack from the rear, saw that his mother
was free of her harness. She stepped up onto the side of the right-hand seat and
out onto the 'thopter's metal skin. Paul followed, dragging the pack by its
straps.
"Run!" he ordered.
He pointed up the dune face and beyond it where they could see a rock tower
undercut by sandblast winds.
Jessica leaped off the 'thopter and ran, scrambling and sliding up the dune.
She heard Paul's panting progress behind. They came out onto a sand ridge that
curved away toward the rocks.
"Follow the ridge," Paul ordered. "It'll be faster."
They slogged toward the rocks, sand gripping their feet.
A new sound began to impress itself on them: a muted whisper, a hissing, an
abrasive slithering.
"Worm," Paul said.
It grew louder.

"Faster!" Paul gasped.
The first rock shingle, like a beach slanting from the sand, lay no more
than ten meters ahead when they heard metal crunch and shatter behind them.
Paul shifted his pack to his right arm, holding it by the straps. It slapped
his side as he ran. He took his mother's arm with his other hand. They scrambled
onto the lifting rock, up a pebble-littered surface through a twisted, windcarved channel. Breath came dry and gasping in their throats.
"I can't run any farther," Jessica panted.
Paul stopped, pressed her into a gut of rock, turned and looked down onto
the desert. A mound-in-motion ran parallel to their rock island--moonlit
ripples, sand waves, a cresting burrow almost level with Paul's eyes at a
distance of about a kilometer. The flattened dunes of its track curved once--a
short loop crossing the patch of desert where they had abandoned their wrecked
ornithopter.
Where the worm had been there was no sign of the aircraft.
The burrow mound moved outward into the desert, coursed back across its own
path, questing.
"It's bigger than a Guild spaceship," Paul whispered. "I was told worms grew
large in the deep desert, but I didn't realize . . . how big."
"Nor I," Jessica breathed.
Again, the thing turned out away from the rocks, sped now with a curving
track toward the horizon. They listened until the sound of its passage was lost
in gentle sand stirrings around them.
Paul took a deep breath, looked up at the moon-frosted escarpment, and
quoted from the Kitab al-Ibar: "Travel by night and rest in black shade through
the day." He looked at his mother. "We still have a few hours of night. Can you
go on?"
"In a moment."
Paul stepped out onto the rock shingle, shouldered the pack and adjusted its
straps. He stood a moment with a paracompass in his hands.
"Whenever you're ready," he said.
She pushed herself away from the rock, feeling her strength return. "Which
direction?"
"Where this ridge leads." He pointed.
"Deep into the desert," she said.
"The Fremen desert," Paul whispered.
And he paused, shaken by the remembered high relief imagery of a prescient
vision he had experienced on Caladan. He had seen this desert. But the set of
the vision had been subtly different, like an optical image that had disappeared
into his consciousness, been absorbed by memory, and now failed of perfect
registry when projected onto the real scene. The vision appeared to have shifted
and approached him from a different angle while he remained motionless.
Idaho was with us in the vision, he remembered. But now Idaho is dead.
"Do you see a way to go?" Jessica asked, mistaking his hesitation.
"No," he said, "But we'll go anyway."
He settled his shoulders more firmly in the pack, struck out up a sandcarved channel in the rock. The channel opened onto a moonlit floor of rock with
benched ledges climbing away to the south.
Paul headed for the first ledge, clambered onto it. Jessica followed.
She noted presently how their passage became a matter of the immediate and
particular--the sand pockets between rocks where their steps were slowed, the
wind-carved ridge that cut their hands, the obstruction that forced a choice: Go
over or go around? The terrain enforced its own rhythms. They spoke only when
necessary and then with the hoarse voices of their exertion.
"Careful here--this ledge is slippery with sand."
"Watch you don't hit your head against this overhang."
"Stay below this ridge; the moon's at our backs and it'd show our movement
to anyone out there."
Paul stopped in a bight of rock, leaned the pack against a narrow ledge.
Jessica leaned beside him, thankful for the moment of rest. She heard Paul
pulling at his stillsuit tube, sipped her own reclaimed water. It tasted
brackish, and she remembered the waters of Caladan--a tall fountain enclosing a
curve of sky, such a richness of moisture that it hadn't been noticed for itself
. . . only for its shape, or its reflection, or its sound as she stopped beside
it.
To stop, she thought. To rest . . . truly rest.
It occurred to her that mercy was the ability to stop, if only for a moment.
There was no mercy where there could be no stopping.
Paul pushed away from the rock ledge, turned, and climbed over a sloping
surface. Jessica followed with a sigh.
They slid down onto a wide shelf that led around a sheer rock face. Again,
they fell into the disjointed rhythm of movement across this broken land.
Jessica felt that the night was dominated by degrees of smallness in
substances beneath their feet and hands--boulders or pea gravel or flaked rock
or pea sand or sand itself or grit or dust or gossamer powder.
The powder clogged nose filters and had to be blown out. Pea sand and pea
gravel rolled on a hard surface and could spill the unwary. Rock flakes cut.
And the omnipresent sand patches dragged against their feet.
Paul stopped abruptly on a rock shelf, steadied his mother as she stumbled
into him.
He was pointing left and she looked along his arm to see that they stood
atop a cliff with the desert stretched out like a static ocean some two hundred
meters below. It lay there full of moon-silvered waves--shadows of angles that
lapsed into curves and, in the distance, lifted to the misted gray blur of
another escarpment.
"Open desert," she said.
"A wide place to cross," Paul said, and his voice was muffled by the filter
trap across his face.
Jessica glanced left and right--nothing but sand below.
Paul stared straight ahead across the open dunes, watching the movement of
shadows in the moon's passage. "About three or four kilometers across," he said.
"Worms," she said.
"Sure to be."
She focused on her weariness, the muscle ache that dulled her senses. "Shall
we rest and eat?"
Paul slipped out of the pack, sat down and leaned against it. Jessica
supported herself by a hand on his shoulder as she sank to the rock beside him.
She felt Paul turn as she settled herself, heard him scrabbling in the pack.
"Here," he said.
His hand felt dry against hers as he pressed two energy capsules into her
palm
She swallowed them with a grudging spit of water from her stillsuit tube.
"Drink all your water," Paul said. "Axiom: the best place to conserve your
water is in your body. It keeps your energy up. You're stronger. Trust your
stillsuit."
She obeyed, drained her catchpockets, feeling energy return. She thought
then how peaceful it was here in this moment of their tiredness, and she
recalled once hearing the minstrel-warrior Gurney Halleck say, "Better a dry
morsel and quietness therewith than a house full of sacrifice and strife."
Jessica repeated the words to Paul.
"That was Gurney," he said.

She caught the tone of his voice, the way he spoke as of someone dead,
thought: And well poor Gurney might be dead. The Atreides forces were either
dead or captive or lost like themselves in this waterless void.
"Gurney always had the right quotation," Paul said. "I can hear him now:
'And I will make the rivers dry, and sell the land into the hand of the wicked;
and I will make the land waste, and all that is therein, by the hand of
strangers.' "
Jessica closed her eyes, found herself moved close to tears by the pathos in
her son's voice.
Presently, Paul said: "How do you . . . feel?"
She recognized that his question was directed at her pregnancy, said: "Your
sister won't be born for many months yet. I still feel . . . physically
adequate."
And she thought: How stiffly formal I speak to my own son! Then, because it
was the Bene Gesserit way to seek within for the answer to such an oddity, she
searched and found the source of her formality: I'm afraid of my son; I fear his
strangeness; I fear what he may see ahead of us, what he may tell me.
Paul pulled his hood down over his eyes, listened to the bug-hustling sounds
of the night. His lungs were charged with his own silence. His nose itched. He
rubbed it, removed the filter and grew conscious of the rich smell of cinnamon.
"There's melange spice nearby," he said.
An eider wind feathered Paul's cheeks, ruffled the folds of his burnoose.
But this wind carried no threat of storm; already he could sense the difference.
"Dawn soon," he said.
Jessica nodded.
"There's a way to get safely across that open sand," Paul said. "The Fremen
do it."
"The worms?"
"If we were to plant a thumper from our Fremkit back in the rocks here,"
Paul said. "It'd keep a worm occupied for a time."
She glanced at the stretch of moonlighted desert between them and the other
escarpment. "Four kilometers worth of time?"
"Perhaps. And if we crossed there making only natural sounds, the kind that
don't attract the worms . . . "
Paul studied the open desert, questing in his prescient memory, probing the
mysterious allusions to thumpers and maker hooks in the Fremkit manual that had
come with their escape pack. He found it odd that all he sensed was pervasive
terror at thought of the worms. He knew as though it lay just at the edge of his
awareness that the worms were to be respected and not feared . . . if . . . if .
. .
He shook his head.
"It'd have to be sounds without rhythm," Jessica said.
"What? Oh. Yes. If we broke our steps . . . the sand itself must shift down
at times. Worms can't investigate every little sound. We should be fully rested
before we try it, though."
He looked across at that other rock wall, seeing the passage of time in the
vertical moonshadows there. "It'll be dawn within the hour."
"Where'll we spend the day?" she asked.
Paul turned left, pointed. "The cliff curves back north over there. You can
see by the way it's wind-cut that's the windward face. There'll be crevasses
there, deep ones."
"Had we better get started?" she asked.
He stood, helped her to her feet. "Are you rested enough for a climb down? I
want to get as close as possible to the desert floor before we camp."
"Enough." She nodded for him to lead the way.
He hesitated, then lifted the pack, settled it onto his shoulders and turned
along the cliff.

If only we had suspensors, Jessica thought. It'd be such a simple matter to
jump down there. But perhaps suspensors are another thing to avoid in the open
desert. Maybe they attract the worms the way a shield does.
They came to a series of shelves dropping down and, beyond them, saw a
fissure with its ledge outlined by moonshadow leading along the vestibule.
Paul led the way down, moving cautiously but hurrying because it was obvious
the moonlight could not last much longer. They wound down into a world of deeper
and deeper shadows. Hints of rock shape climbed to the stars around them. The
fissure narrowed to some ten meters' width at the brink of a dim gray sandslope
that slanted downward into darkness.
"Can we do down?" Jessica whispered.
"I think so."
He tested the surface with one foot.
"We can slide down," he said. "I'll go first. Wait until you hear me stop."
"Careful," she said.
He stepped onto the slope and slid and slipped down its soft surface onto an
almost level floor of packed sand. The place was deep within the rock walls.
There came the sound of sand sliding behind him. He tried to see up the
slope in the darkness, was almost knocked over by the cascade. It trailed away
to silence.
"Mother?" he said.
There was no answer.
"Mother?"
He dropped the pack, hurled himself up the slope, scrambling, digging,
throwing sand like a wild man. "Mother!" he gasped. "Mother, where are you?"
Another cascade of sand swept down on him, burying him to the hips. He
wrenched himself out of it.
She's been caught in the sandslide, he thought. Buried in it. I must be calm
and work this out carefully. She won't smother immediately. She'll compose
herself in bindu suspension to reduce her oxygen needs. She knows I'll dig for
her.
In the Bene Gesserit way she had taught him, Paul stilled the savage beating
of his heart, set his mind as a blank slate upon which the past few moments
could write themselves. Every partial shift and twist of the slide replayed
itself in his memory, moving with an interior stateliness that contrasted with
the fractional second of real time required for the total recall.
Presently, Paul moved slantwise up the slope, probing cautiously until he
found the wall of the fissure, an outcurve of rock there. He began to dig,
moving the sand with care not to dislodge another slide. A piece of fabric came
under his hands. He followed it, found an arm. Gently, he traced the arm,
exposed her face.
"Do you hear me?" he whispered.
No answer.
He dug faster, freed her shoulders. She was limp beneath his hands, but he
detected a slow heartbeat.
Bindu suspension, he told himself.
He cleared the sand away to her waist, draped her arms over his shoulders
and pulled downslope, slowly at first, then dragging her as fast as he could,
feeling the sand give way above. Faster and faster he pulled her, gasping with
the effort, fighting to keep his balance. He was out on the hard-packed floor of
the fissure then, swinging her to his shoulder and breaking into a staggering
run as the entire sandslope came down with a loud hiss that echoed and was
magnified within the rock walls.
He stopped at the end of the fissure where it looked out on the desert's
marching dunes some thirty meters below. Gently, he lowered her to the sand,
uttered the word to bring her out of the catalepsis.
She awakened slowly, taking deeper and deeper breaths.

"I knew you'd find me," she whispered.
He looked back up the fissure. "It might have been kinder if I hadn't."
"Paul!"
"I lost the pack," he said. "It's buried under a hundred tons of sand . . .
at least."
"Everything?"
"The spare water, the stilltent--everything that counts." He touched a
pocket. "I still have the paracompass." He fumbled at the waist sash. "Knife and
binoculars. We can get a good look around the place where we'll die."
In that instant, the sun lifted above the horizon somewhere to the left
beyond the end of the fissure. Colors blinked in the sand out on the open
desert. A chorus of birds held forth their songs from hidden places among the
rocks.
But Jessica had eyes only for the despair in Paul's face. She edged her
voice with scorn, said: "Is this the way you were taught?"
"Don't you understand?" he asked. "Everything we need to survive in this
place is under that sand."
"You found me," she said, and now her voice was soft, reasonable.
Paul squatted back on his heels.
Presently, he looked up the fissure at the new slope, studying it, marking
the looseness of the sand.
"If we could immobilize a small area of that slope and the upper face of a
hole dug into the sand, we might be able to put down a shaft to the pack. Water
might do it, but we don't have enough water for . . ." He broke off, then:
"Foam."
Jessica held herself to stillness lest she disturb the hyper-functioning of
his mind.
Paul looked out at the open dunes, searching with his nostrils as well as
his eyes, finding the direction and then centering his attention on a darkened
patch of sand below them.
"Spice," he said. "Its essence--highly alkaline. And I have the paracompass.
Its power pack is acid-base."
Jessica sat up straight against the rock.
Paul ignored her, leaped to his feet, and was off down the wind-compacted
surface that spilled from the end of the fissure to the desert's floor.
She watched the way he walked, breaking his stride--step . . . pause, stepstep . . . slide . . . pause . . .
There was no rhythm to it that might tell a marauding worm something not of
the desert moved here.
Paul reached the spice patch, shoveled a mound of it into a fold of his
robe, returned to the fissure. He spilled the spice onto the sand in front of
Jessica, squatted and began dismantling the paracompass, using the point of his
knife. The compass face came off. He removed his sash, spread the compass parts
on it, lifted out the power pack. The dial mechanism came out next, leaving an
empty dished compartment in the instrument.
"You'll need water," Jessica said.
Paul took the catchtube from his neck, sucked up a mouthful, expelled it
into the dished compartment.
If this fails, that's water wasted, Jessica thought. But it won't matter
then, anyway.
With his knife, Paul cut open the power pack, spilled its crystals into the
water. They foamed slightly, subsided.
Jessica's eyes caught motion above them. She looked up to see a line of
hawks along the rim of the fissure. They perched there staring down at the open
water.
Great Mother! she thought. They can sense water even at that distance!

Paul had the cover back on the paracompass, leaving off the reset button
which gave a small hole into the liquid. Taking the reworked instrument in one
hand, a handful of spice in the other, Paul went back up the fissure, studying
the lay of the slope. His robe billowed gently without the sash to hold it. He
waded part way up the slope, kicking off sand rivulets, spurts of dust.
Presently, he stopped, pressed a pinch of the spice into the paracompass,
shook the instrument case.
Green foam boiled out of the hole where the reset button had been. Paul
aimed it at the slope, spread a low dike there, began kicking away the sand
beneath it, immobilizing the opened face with more foam.
Jessica moved to a position below him, called out: "May I help?"
"Come up and dig," he said. "We've about three meters to go. It's going to
be a near thing." As he spoke, the foam stopped billowing from the instrument.
"Quickly," Paul said. "No telling how long this foam will hold the sand."
Jessica scrambled up beside Paul as he sifted another pinch of spice into
the hole, shook the paracompass case. Again, foam boiled from it.
As Paul directed the foam barrier, Jessica dug with her hands, hurling the
sand down the slope. "How deep?" she panted.
"About three meters," he said. "And I can only approximate the position. We
may have to widen this hole." He moved a step aside, slipping in loose sand.
"Slant your digging backward. Don't go straight down."
Jessica obeyed.
Slowly, the hole went down, reaching a level even with the floor of the
basin and still no sign of the pack.
Could I have miscalculated? Paul asked himself. I'm the one that panicked
originally and caused this mistake. Has that warped my ability?
He looked at the paracompass. Less than two ounces of the acid infusion
remained.
Jessica straightened in the hole, rubbed a foam-stained hand across her
cheek. Her eyes met Paul's.
"The upper face," Paul said. "Gently, now." He added another pinch of spice
to the container, sent the foam boiling around Jessica's hands as she began
cutting a vertical face in the upper slant of the hole. On the second pass, her
hands encountered something hard. Slowly, she worked out a length of strap with
a plastic buckle.
"Don't move any more of it," Paul said and his voice was almost a whisper.
"We're out of foam."
Jessica held the strap in one hand, looked up at him.
Paul threw the empty paracompass down onto the floor of the basin, said:
"Give me your other hand. Now listen carefully. I'm going to pull you to the
side and downhill. Don't let go of that strap. We won't get much more spill from
the top. This slope has stabilized itself. All I'm going to aim for is to keep
your head free of the sand. Once that hole's filled, we can dig you out and pull
up the pack."
"I understand," she said.
"Ready?"
"Ready." She tensed her fingers on the strap.
With one surge, Paul had her half out of the hole, holding her head up as
the foam barrier gave way and sand spilled down. When it had subsided, Jessica
remained buried to the waist, her left arm and shoulder still under the sand,
her chin protected on a fold of Paul's robe. Her shoulder ached from the strain
put on it.
"I still have the strap," she said.
Slowly, Paul worked his hand into the sand beside her, found the strap.
"Together," he said. "Steady pressure. We mustn't break it."
More sand spilled down as they worked the pack up. When the strap cleared
the surface, Paul stopped, freed his mother from the sand. Together then they
pulled the pack downslope and out of its trap.
In a few minutes they stood on the floor of the fissure holding the pack
between them.
Paul looked at his mother. Foam stained her face, her robe. Sand was caked
to her where the foam had dried. She looked as though she had been a target for
balls of wet, green sand.
"You look a mess," he said.
"You're not so pretty yourself," she said.
They started to laugh, then sobered.
"That shouldn't have happened," Paul said. "I was careless."
She shrugged, feeling caked sand fall away from her robe.
"I'll put up the tent," he said. "Better slip off that robe and shake it
out." He turned away, taking the pack.
Jessica nodded, suddenly too tired to answer.
"There's anchor holes in the rock," Paul said. "Someone's tented here
before."
Why not? she thought as she brushed at her robe. This was a likely place-deep in rock walls and facing another cliff some four kilometers away--far
enough above the desert to avoid worms but close enough for easy access before a
crossing.
She turned, seeing that Paul had the tent up, its rib-domed hemisphere
blending with the rock walls of the fissure. Paul stepped past her, lifting his
binoculars. He adjusted their internal pressure with a quick twist, focused the
oil lenses on the other cliff lifting golden tan in morning light across open
sand.
Jessica watched as he studied that apocalyptic landscape, his eyes probing
into sand rivers and canyons.
"There are growing things over there," he said.
Jessica found the spare binoculars in the pack beside the tent, moved up
beside Paul.
"There," he said, holding the binoculars with one hand and pointing with the
other.
She looked where he pointed.
"Saguaro," she said. "Scrawny stuff."
"There may be people nearby," Paul said.
"That could be the remains of a botanical testing station," she warned.
"This is pretty far south into the desert," he said. He lowered his
binoculars, rubbed beneath his filter baffle, feeling how dry and chapped his
lips were, sensing the dusty taste of thirst in his mouth. "This has the feeling
of a Fremen place," he said.
"Are we certain the Fremen will be friendly?" she asked.
"Kynes promised their help."
But there's desperation in the people of this desert, she thought. I felt
some of it myself today. Desperate people might kill us for our water.
She closed her eyes and, against this wasteland, conjured in her mind a
scene from Caladan. There had been a vacation trip once on Caladan--she and the
Duke Leto, before Paul's birth. They'd flown over the southern jungles, above
the weed-wild shouting leaves and rice paddies of the deltas. And they had seen
the ant lines in the greenery--man-gangs carrying their loads on suspensorbuoyed shoulder poles. And in the sea reaches there'd been the white petals of
trimaran dhows.
All of it gone.
Jessica opened her eyes to the desert stillness, to the mounting warmth of
the day. Restless heat devils were beginning to set the air aquiver out on the
open sand. The other rock face across from them was like a thing seen through
cheap glass.
A spill of sand spread its brief curtain across the open end of the fissure.
The sand hissed down, loosed by puffs of morning breeze, by the hawks that were
beginning to lift away from the clifftop. When the sandfall was gone, she still
heard it hissing. It grew louder, a sound that once heard, was never forgotten.
"Worm," Paul whispered.
It came from their right with an uncaring majesty that could not be ignored.
A twisting burrow-mound of sand cut through the dunes within their field of
vision. The mound lifted in front, dusting away like a bow wave in water. Then
it was gone, coursing off to the left.
The sound diminished, died.
"I've seen space frigates that were smaller," Paul whispered.
She nodded, continuing to stare across the desert. Where the worm had passed
there remained that tantalizing gap. It flowed bitterly endless before them,
beckoning beneath its horizontal collapse of skyline.
"When we've rested," Jessica said, "we should continue with your lessons."
He suppressed a sudden anger, said: "Mother, don't you think we could do
without . . ."
"Today you panicked," she said. "You know your mind and bindu-nervature
perhaps better than I do, but you've much yet to learn about your body's pranamusculature. The body does things of itself sometimes, Paul, and I can teach you
about this. You must learn to control every muscle, every fiber of your body.
You need review of the hands. We'll start with finger muscles, palm tendons, and
tip sensitivity." She turned away. "Come, into the tent, now."
He flexed the fingers of his left hand, watching her crawl through the
sphincter valve, knowing that he could not deflect her from this determination .
. . that he must agree.
Whatever has been done to me, I've been a party to it, he thought.
Review of the hand!
He looked at his hand. How inadequate it appeared when measured against such
creatures as that worm.

We came from Caladan--a paradise world for our form of fife. There existed no
need on Caladan to build a physical paradise or a paradise of the mind--we could
see the actuality all around us. And the price we paid was the price men have
always paid for achieving a paradise in this life--we went soft, we lost our
edge.
-from "Muad'Dib: Conversations" by the Princess Irulan
"So you're the great Gurney Halleck," the man said.
Halleck stood staring across the round cavern office at the smuggler seated
behind a metal desk. The man wore Fremen robes and had the half-tint blue eyes
that told of off-planet foods in his diet. The office duplicated a space
frigate's master control center--communications and viewscreens along a thirtydegree arc of wall, remote arming and firing banks adjoining, and the desk
formed as a wall projection--part of the remaining curve.
"I am Staban Tuek, son of Esmar Tuek," the smuggler said.
"Then you're the one I owe thanks for the help we've received," Halleck
said.
"Ah-h-h, gratitude," the smuggler said. "Sit down."
A ship-type bucket seat emerged from the wall beside the screens and Halleck
sank onto it with a sigh, feeling his weariness. He could see his own reflection
now in a dark surface beside the smuggler and scowled at the lines of fatigue in
his lumpy face. The inkvine scar along his jaw writhed with the scowl.

Halleck turned from his reflection, stared at Tuek. He saw the family
resemblance in the smuggler now--the father's heavy, over-hanging eyebrows and
rock planes of cheeks and nose.
"Your men tell me your father is dead, killed by the Harkonnens," Halleck
said.
"By the Harkonnens or by a traitor among your people," Tuek said.
Anger overcame part of Halleck's fatigue. He straightened, said: "Can you
name the traitor?"
"We are not sure."
"Thufir Hawat suspected the Lady Jessica."
"Ah-h-h, the Bene Gesserit witch . . . perhaps. But Hawat is now a Harkonnen
captive."
"I heard," Halleck took a deep breath. "It appears we've a deal more killing
ahead of us."
"We will do nothing to attract attention to us," Tuek said.
Halleck stiffened. "But--"
"You and those of your men we've saved are welcome to sanctuary among us,"
Tuek said. "You speak of gratitude. Very well; work off your debt to us. We can
always use good men. We'll destroy you out of hand, though, if you make the
slightest open move against the Harkonnens."
"But they killed your father, man!"
"Perhaps. And if so, I'll give you my father's answer to those who act
without thinking: 'A stone is heavy and the sand is weighty; but a fool's wrath
is heavier than them both.' "
"You mean to do nothing about it, then?" Halleck sneered.
"You did not hear me say that. I merely say I will protect our contract with
the Guild. The Guild requires that we play a circumspect game. There are other
ways of destroying a foe."
"Ah-h-h-h-h."
"Ah, indeed. If you've a mind to seek out the witch, have at it. But I warn
you that you're probably too late . . .and we doubt she's the one you want, any
way."
"Hawat made few mistakes."
"He allowed himself to fall into Harkonnen hands."
"You think he's the traitor?"
Tuek shrugged. "This is academic. We think the witch is dead. At least the
Harkonnens believe it."
"You seem to know a great deal about the Harkonnens."
"Hints and suggestions . . . rumors and hunches."
"We are seventy-four men," Halleck said. "If you seriously wish us to enlist
with you, you must believe our Duke is dead."
"His body has been seen."
"And the boy, too--young Master Paul?" Halleck tried to swallow, found a
lump in his throat.
"According to the last word we had, he was lost with his mother in a desert
storm. Likely not even their bones will ever be found."
"So the witch is dead then . . . all dead."
Tuek nodded. "And Beast Rabban, so they say, will sit once more in the seat
of power here on Dune."
"The Count Rabban of Lankiveil?"
"Yes."
It took Halleck a moment to put down the upsurge of rage that threatened to
overcome him. He spoke with panting breath: "I've a score of my own against
Rabban. I owe him for the lives of my family . . . " He rubbed at the scar along
his jaw. " . . . and for this . . . "
"One does not risk everything to settle a score prematurely," Tuek said. He
frowned, watching the play of muscles along Halleck's jaw, the sudden withdrawal
in the man's shed-lidded eyes.
"I know . . . I know." Halleck took a deep breath.
"You and your men can work out your passage off Arrakis by serving with us.
There are many places to--"
"I release my men from any bond to me; they can choose for themselves. With
Rabban here--I stay."
"In your mood, I'm not sure we want you to stay."
Halleck stared at the smuggler. "You doubt my word?"
"No-o-o . . . "
"You've saved me from the Harkonnens. I gave loyalty to the Duke Leto for no
greater reason. I'll stay on Arrakis--with you . . . or with the Fremen."
"Whether a thought is spoken or not it is a real thing and it has power,"
Tuek said. "You might find the line between life and death among the Fremen to
be too sharp and quick."
Halleck closed his eyes briefly, feeling the weariness surge up in him.
"Where is the Lord who led us through the land of deserts and of pits?" he
murmured.
"Move slowly and the day of your revenge will come," Tuek said. "Speed is a
device of Shaitan. Cool your sorrow--we've the diversions for it; three things
there are that ease the heart--water, green grass, and the beauty of woman."
Halleck opened his eyes. "I would prefer the blood of Rabban Harkonnen
flowing about my feet." He stared at Tuek. "You think that day will come?"
"I have little to do with how you'll meet tomorrow, Gurney Halleck. I can
only help you meet today."
"Then I'll accept that help and stay until the day you tell me to revenge
your father and all the others who--"
"Listen to me, fighting man," Tuek said. He leaned forward over his desk,
his shoulders level with his ears, eyes intent. The smuggler's face was suddenly
like weathered stone. "My father's water--I'll buy that back myself, with my own
blade."
Halleck stared back at Tuek. In that moment, the smuggler reminded him of
Duke Leto: a leader of men, courageous, secure in his own position and his own
course. He was like the Duke . . . before Arrakis.
"Do you wish my blade beside you?" Halleck asked.
Tuek sat back, relaxed, studying Halleck silently.
"Do you think of me as fighting man? " Halleck pressed.
"You're the only one of the Duke's lieutenants to escape," Tuek said. "Your
enemy was overwhelming, yet you rolled with him . . . You defeated him the way
we defeat Arrakis."
"Eh?"
"We live on sufferance down here, Gurney Halleck," Tuek said. "Arrakis is
our enemy."
"One enemy at a time, is that it?"
"That's it."
"Is that the way the Fremen make out?"
"Perhaps."
"You said I might find life with the Fremen too tough. They live in the
desert, in the open, is that why?"
"Who knows where the Fremen live? For us, the Central Plateau is a no-man's
land. But I wish to talk more about--"
"I'm told that the Guild seldom routes spice lighters in over the desert,"
Halleck said. "But there are rumors that you can see bits of greenery here and
there if you know where to look."
"Rumors!" Tuek sneered. "Do you wish to choose now between me and the
Fremen? We have a measure of security, our own sietch carved out of the rock,
our own hidden basins. We live the lives of civilized men. The Fremen are a few
ragged bands that we use as spice-hunters."
"But they can kill Harkonnens."
"And do you wish to know the result? Even now they are being hunted down
like animals--with lasguns, because they have no shields. They are being
exterminated. Why? Because they killed Harkonnens."
"Was it Harkonnens they killed?" Halleck asked.
"What do you mean?"
"Haven't you heard that there may've been Sardaukar with the Harkonnens?"
"More rumors."
"But a pogrom--that isn't like the Harkonnens. A pogrom is wasteful."
"I believe what I see with my own eyes," Tuek said. "Make your choice,
fighting man. Me or the Fremen. I will promise you sanctuary and a chance to
draw the blood we both want. Be sure of that. The Fremen will offer you only the
life of the hunted."
Halleck hesitated, sensing wisdom and sympathy in Tuek's words, yet troubled
for no reason he could explain.
"Trust your own abilities," Tuek said. "Whose decisions brought your force
through the battle? Yours. Decide."
"It must be," Halleck said. "The Duke and his son are dead?"
"The Harkonnens believe it. Where such things are concerned, I incline to
trust the Harkonnens." A grim smile touched Tuek's mouth. "But it's about the
only trust I give them."
"Then it must be," Halleck repeated. He held out his right hand, palm up and
thumb folded flat against it in the traditional gesture. "I give you my sword."
"Accepted."
"Do you wish me to persuade my men?"
"You'd let them make their own decision?"
"They've followed me this far, but most are Caladan-born. Arrakis isn't what
they thought it'd be. Here, they've lost everything except their lives. I'd
prefer they decided for themselves now."
"Now is no time for you to falter," Tuek said. "They've followed you this
far."
"You need them, is that it?"
"We can always use experienced fighting men . . . in these times more than
ever."
"You've accepted my sword. Do you wish me to persuade them?"
"I think they'll follow you, Gurney Halleck."
" 'Tis to be hoped."
"Indeed."
"I may make my own decision in this, then?"
"Your own decision."
Halleck pushed himself up from the bucket seat, feeling how much of his
reserve strength even that small effort required. "For now, I'll see to their
quarters and well-being," he said.
"Consult my quartermaster," Tuek said. "Drisq is his name. Tell him it's my
wish that you receive every courtesy. I'll join you myself presently. I've some
off-shipments of spice to see to first."
"Fortune passes everywhere," Halleck said.
"Everywhere," Tuek said. "A time of upset is a rare opportunity for our
business."
Halleck nodded, heard the faint sussuration and felt the air shift as a
lockport swung open beside him. He turned, ducked through it and out of the
office.
He found himself in the assembly hall through which he and his men had been
led by Tuek's aides. It was a long, fairly narrow area chewed out of the native
rock, its smooth surface betraying the use of cutteray burners for the job. The
ceiling stretched away high enough to continue the natural supporting curve of
the rock and to permit internal air-convection currents. Weapons racks and
lockers lined the walls.
Halleck noted with a touch of pride that those of his men still able to
stand were standing--no relaxation in weariness and defeat for them. Smuggler
medics were moving among them tending the wounded. Litter cases were assembled
in one area down to the left, each wounded man with an Atreides companion.
The Atreides training--"We care for our own!"--it held like a core of native
rock in them, Halleck noted.
One of his lieutenants stepped forward carrying Halleck's nine-string
baliset out of its case. The man snapped a salute, said: "Sir, the medics here
say there's no hope for Mattai. They have no bone and organ banks here--only
outpost medicine. Mattai can't last, they say, and he has a request of you."
"What is it?"
The lieutenant thrust the baliset forward. "Mattai wants a song to ease his
going, sir. He says you'll know the one . . . he's asked it of you often
enough." The lieutenant swallowed. "It's the one called 'My Woman,' sir. If you-"
"I know." Halleck took the baliset, flicked the multipick out of its catch
on the fingerboard. He drew a soft chord from the instrument, found that someone
had already tuned it. There was a burning in his eyes, but he drove that out of
his thoughts as he strolled forward, strumming the tune, forcing himself to
smile casually.
Several of his men and a smuggler medic were bent over one of the litters.
One of the men began singing softly as Halleck approached, catching the counterbeat with the ease of long familiarity:
"My woman stands at her window,
Curved lines 'gainst square glass.
Uprais'd arms . . . bent . . . downfolded.
'Gainst sunset red and golded-Come to me . . .
Come to me, warm arms of my lass.
For me . . .
For me, the warm arms of my lass."
The singer stopped, reached out a bandaged arm and closed the eyelids of the
man on the litter.
Halleck drew a final soft chord from the baliset, thinking: Now we are
seventy-three.

Family life of the Royal Creche is difficult for many people to understand, but
I shall try to give you a capsule view of it. My father had only one real
friend, I think. That was Count Hasimir Fenring, the genetic-eunuch and one of
the deadliest fighters in the Imperium. The Count, a dapper and ugly little man,
brought a new slave-concubine to my father one day and I was dispatched by my
mother to spy on the proceedings. All of us spied on my father as a matter of
self-protection. One of the slave-concubines permitted my father under the Bene
Gesserit-Guild agreement could not, of course, bear a Royal Successor, but the
intrigues were constant and oppressive in their similarity. We became adept, my
mother and sisters and I, at avoiding subtle instruments of death. It may seem a
dreadful thing to say, but I 'm not at all sure my father was innocent in all
these attempts. A Royal Family is not like other families. Here was a new slaveconcubine, then, red-haired like my father, willowy and graceful. She had a
dancer's muscles, and her training obviously had included neuro-enticement. My
father looked at her for a long time as she postured unclothed before him.
Finally he said: "She is too beautiful. We will save her as a gift. " You have
no idea how much consternation this restraint created in the Royal Creche.
Subtlety and self-control were, after all, the most deadly threats to us all.
-"In My Father's House" by the Princess Irulan
Paul stood outside the stilltent in the late afternoon. The crevasse where
he had pitched their camp lay in deep shadow. He stared out across the open sand
at the distant cliff, wondering if he should waken his mother, who lay asleep in
the tent.
Folds upon folds of dunes spread beyond their shelter. Away from the setting
sun, the dunes exposed greased shadows so black they were like bits of night.
And the flatness.
His mind searched for something tall in that landscape. But there was no
persuading tallness out of heat-addled air and that horizon--no bloom or gently
shaken thing to mark the passage of a breeze . . . only dunes and that distant
cliff beneath a sky of burnished silver-blue.
What if there isn't one of the abandoned testing stations across there? he
wondered. What if there are no Fremen, either, and the plants we see are only an
accident?
Within the tent, Jessica awakened, turned onto her back and peered sidelong
out the transparent end at Paul, He stood with his back to her and something
about his stance reminded her of his father. She sensed the well of grief rising
within her and turned away.
Presently she adjusted her stillsuit, refreshed herself with water from the
tent's catchpocket, and slipped out to stand and stretch the sleep from her
muscles.
Paul spoke without turning: "I find myself enjoying the quiet here."
How the mind gears itself for its environment, she thought. And she recalled
a Bene Gesserit axiom: "The mind can go either direction under stress--toward
positive or toward negative: on or off. Think of it as a spectrum whose extremes
are unconsciousness at the negative end and hyperconsciousness at the positive
end. The way the mind will lean under stress is strongly influenced by
training."
"It could be a good life here," Paul said.
She tried to see the desert through his eyes, seeking to encompass all the
rigors this planet accepted as commonplace, wondering at the possible futures
Paul had glimpsed. One could be alone out here, she thought, without fear of
someone behind you, without fear of the hunter.
She stepped past Paul, lifted her binoculars, adjusted the oil lenses and
studied the escarpment across from them. Yes, saguaro in the arroyos and other
spiny growth . . . and a matting of low grasses, yellow-green in the shadows.
"I'll strike camp," Paul said.
Jessica nodded, walked to the fissure's mouth where she could get a sweep of
the desert, and swung her binoculars to the left. A salt pan glared white there
with a blending of dirty tan at its edges--a field of white out here where white
was death. But the pan said another thing: water. At some time water had flowed
across that glaring white. She lowered her binoculars, adjusted her burnoose,
listened for a moment to the sound of Paul's movements.
The sun dipped lower. Shadows stretched across the salt pan. Lines of wild
color spread over the sunset horizon. Color streamed into a toe of darkness
testing the sand. Coal-colored shadows spread, and the thick collapse of night
blotted the desert.
Stars!
She stared up at them, sensing Paul's movements as he came up beside her.
The desert night focused upward with a feeling of lift toward the stars. The
weight of the day receded. There came a brief flurry of breeze across her face.

"The first moon will be up soon," Paul said. "The pack's ready. I've
planted the thumper."
We could be lost forever in this hellplace, she thought. And no one to know.
The night wind spread sand runnels that grated across her face, bringing the
smell of cinnamon: a shower of odors in the dark.
"Smell that," Paul said.
"I can smell it even through the filter," she said. "Riches. But will it buy
water?" She pointed across the basin. "There are no artificial lights across
there."
"Fremen would be hidden in a sietch behind those rocks," he said.
A sill of silver pushed above the horizon to their right: the first moon. It
lifted into view, the hand pattern plain on its face. Jessica studied the whitesilver of sand exposed in the light.
"I planted the thumper in the deepest part of the crevasse," Paul said.
"Whenever I light its candle it'll give us about thirty minutes."
"Thirty minutes?"
"Before it starts calling . . . a . . . worm."
"Oh. I'm ready to go."
He slipped away from her side and she heard his progress back up their
fissure.
The night is a tunnel, she thought, a hole into tomorrow . . . if we 're to
have a tomorrow. She shook her head. Why must I be so morbid? I was trained
better than that!
Paul returned, took up the pack, led the way down to the first spreading
dune where he stopped and listened as his mother came up behind him. He heard
her soft progress and the cold single-grain dribbles of sound--the desert's own
code spelling out its measure of safety.
"We must walk without rhythm," Paul said and he called up memory of men
walking the sand . . . both prescient memory and real memory.
"Watch how I do it," he said. "This is how Fremen walk the sand."
He stepped out onto the windward face of the dune, following the curve of
it, moved with a dragging pace.
Jessica studied his progress for ten steps, followed, imitating him. She saw
the sense of it: they must sound like the natural shifting of sand . . . like
the wind. But muscles protested this unnatural, broken pattern: Step . . . drag
. . . drag . . . step . . . step . . . wait . . . drag . . . step . . .
Time stretched out around them. The rock face ahead seemed to grow no
nearer. The one behind still lowered high.
"Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!"
It was a drumming from the cliff behind.
"The thumper," Paul hissed.
Its pounding continued and they found difficulty avoiding the rhythm of it
in their stride.
"Lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . lump . . ."
They moved in a moonlit bowl punctured by that hollowed thumping. Down and
up through spilling dunes: step . . .drag . . . wait . . . step . . . Across pea
sand that rolled under their feet: drag . . . wait . . . step . . .
And all the while their ears searched for a special hissing.
The sound, when it came, started so low that their own dragging passage
masked it. But it grew . . . louder and louder . . . out of the west.
"Lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . " drummed the thumper.
The hissing approach spread across the night behind them. They turned their
heads as they walked, saw the mound of the coursing worm.
"Keep moving," Paul whispered. "Don't look back."
A grating sound of fury exploded from the rock shadows they had left. It was
a flailing avalanche of noise.
"Keep moving," Paul repeating.

He saw that they had reached an unmarked point where the two rock faces--the
one ahead and the one behind--appeared equally remote.
And still behind them, that whipping, frenzied tearing of rocks dominated
the night.
They moved on and on and on . . . Muscles reached a stage of mechanical
aching that seemed to stretch out indefinitely, but Paul saw that the beckoning,
escarpment ahead of them had climbed higher.
Jessica moved in a void of concentration, aware that the pressure of her
will alone kept her walking. Dryness ached in her mouth, but the sounds behind
drove away all hope of stopping for a sip from her stillsuit's catchpockets.
"Lump . . . lump . . . "
Renewed frenzy erupted from the distant cliff, drowning out the thumper.
Silence!
"Faster," Paul whispered.
She nodded, knowing he did not see the gesture, but needing the action to
tell herself that it was necessary to demand even more from muscles that already
were being taxed to their limits--the unnatural movement . . .
The rock face of safety ahead of them climbed into the stars, and Paul saw a
plane of flat sand stretching out at the base. He stepped onto it, stumbled in
his fatigue, righted himself with an involuntary out-thrusting of a foot.
Resonant booming shook the sand around them.
Paul lurched sideways two steps.
"Boom! Boom!"
"Drum sand!" Jessica hissed.
Paul recovered his balance. A sweeping glance took in the sand around them,
the rock escarpment perhaps two hundred meters away.
Behind them, he heard a hissing--like the wind, like a riptide where there
was no water.
"Run!" Jessica screamed. "Paul, run!"
They ran.
Drum sound boomed beneath their feet. Then they were out of it and into pea
gravel. For a time, the running was a relief to muscles that ached from
unfamiliar, rhythmless use. Here was action that could be understood. Here was
rhythm. But sand and gravel dragged at their feet. And the hissing approach of
the worm was storm sound that grew around them.
Jessica stumbled to her knees. All she could think of was the fatigue and
the sound and the terror.
Paul dragged her up.
They ran on, hand in hand.
A thin pole jutted from the sand ahead of them. They passed it, saw another.
Jessica's mind failed to register on the poles until they were past.
There was another--wind-etched surface thrust up from a crack in rock.
Another.
Rock!
She felt it through her feet, the shock of unresisting surface, gained new
strength from the firmer footing.
A deep crack stretched its vertical shadow upward into the cliff ahead of
them. They sprinted for it, crowded into the narrow hole.
Behind them, the sound of the worm's passage stopped.
Jessica and Paul turned, peered out onto the desert.
Where the dunes began, perhaps fifty meters away at the foot of a rock
beach, a silver-gray curve broached from the desert, sending rivers of sand and
dust cascading all around. It lifted higher, resolved into a giant, questing
mouth. It was a round, black hole with edges glistening in the moonlight.
The mouth snaked toward the narrow crack where Paul and Jessica huddled.
Cinnamon yelled in their nostrils. Moonlight flashed from crystal teeth.
Back and forth the great mouth wove.

Paul stilled his breathing.
Jessica crouched staring.
It took intense concentration of her Bene Gesserit training to put down the
primal terrors, subduing a race-memory fear that threatened to fill her mind.
Paul felt a kind of elation. In some recent instant, he had crossed a time
barrier into more unknown territory. He could sense the darkness ahead, nothing
revealed to his inner eye. It was as though some step he had taken had plunged
him into a well . . . or into the trough of a wave where the future was
invisible. The landscape had undergone a profound shifting.
Instead of frightening him, the sensation of time-darkness forced a hyperacceleration of his other senses. He found himself registering every available
aspect of the thing that lifted from the sand there seeking him. Its mouth was
some eighty meters in diameter . . . crystal teeth with the curved shape of
crysknives glinting around the rim . . . the bellows breath of cinnamon, subtle
aldehydes . . . acids . . .
The worm blotted out the moonlight as it brushed the rocks above them. A
shower of small stones and sand cascaded into the narrow hiding place.
Paul crowded his mother farther back.
Cinnamon!
The smell of it flooded across him.
What has the worm to do with the spice, melange? he asked himself. And he
remembered Liet-Kynes betraying a veiled reference to some association between
worm and spice.
"Barrrroooom!"
It was like a peal of dry thunder coming from far off to their right.
Again: "Barrrroooom!"
The worm drew back onto the sand, lay there momentarily, its crystal teeth
weaving moonflashes.
"Lump! Lump! Lump! Lump!"
Another thumper! Paul thought.
Again it sounded off to their right.
A shudder passed through the worm. It drew farther away into the sand. Only
a mounded upper curve remained like half a bell mouth, the curve of a tunnel
rearing above the dunes.
Sand rasped.
The creature sank farther, retreating, turning. It became a mound of
cresting sand that curved away through a saddle in the dunes.
Paul stepped out of the crack, watched the sand wave recede across the waste
toward the new thumper summons.
Jessica followed, listening: "Lump . . . lump . . . lump . . . lump . . .
lump . . ."
Presently the sound stopped.
Paul found the tube into his stillsuit, sipped at the reclaimed water.
Jessica focused on his action, but her mind felt blank with fatigue and the
aftermath of terror. "Has it gone for sure?" she whispered.
"Somebody called it," Paul said. "Fremen."
She felt herself recovering. "It was so big!"
"Not as big as the one that got our 'thopter."
"Are you sure it was Fremen?"
"They used a thumper."
"Why would they help us?"
"Maybe they weren't helping us. Maybe they were just calling a worm."
"Why?"
An answer lay poised at the edge of his awareness, but refused to come. He
had a vision in his mind of something to do with the telescoping barbed sticks
in their packs--the "maker hooks."
"Why would they call a worm?" Jessica asked.

A breath of fear touched his mind, and he forced himself to turn away from
his mother, to look up the cliff. "We'd better find a way up there before
daylight." He pointed. "Those poles we passed--there are more of them."
She looked, following the line of his hand, saw the poles--wind-scratched
markers--made out the shadow of a narrow ledge that twisted into a crevasse high
above them.
"They mark a way up the cliff," Paul said. He settled his shoulders into the
pack, crossed to the foot of the ledge and began the climb upward.
Jessica waited a moment, resting, restoring her strength; then she followed.
Up they climbed, following the guide poles until the ledge dwindled to a
narrow lip at the mouth of a dark crevasse.
Paul tipped his head to peer into the shadowed place. He could feel the
precarious hold his feet had on the slender ledge, but forced himself to slow
caution. He saw only darkness within the crevasse. It stretched away upward,
open to the stars at the top. His ears searched, found only sounds he could
expect--a tiny spill of sand, an insect brrr, the patter of a small running
creature. He tested the darkness in the crevasse with one foot, found rock
beneath a gritting surface. Slowly, he inched around the corner, signaled for
his mother to follow. He grasped a loose edge of her robe, helped her around.
They looked upward at starlight framed by two rock lips. Paul saw his mother
beside him as a cloudy gray movement. "If we could only risk a light," he
whispered.
"We have other senses than eyes," she said.
Paul slid a foot forward, shifted his weight, and probed with the other
foot, met an obstruction. He lifted his foot, found a step, pulled himself up
onto it. He reached back, felt his mother's arm, tugged at her robe for her to
follow.
Another step.
"It goes on up to the top, I think," he whispered.
Shallow and even steps, Jessica thought. Man-carved beyond a doubt.
She followed the shadowy movement of Paul's progress, feeling out the steps.
Rock walls narrowed until her shoulders almost brushed them. The steps ended in
a slitted defile about twenty meters long, its floor level, and this opened onto
a shallow, moonlit basin.
Paul stepped out into the rim of the basin, whispered: "What a beautiful
place."
Jessica could only stare in silent agreement from her position a step behind
him.
In spite of weariness, the irritation of recaths and nose plugs and the
confinement of the stillsuit, in spite of fear and the aching desire for rest,
this basin's beauty filled her senses, forcing her to stop and admire it.
"Like a fairyland," Paul whispered.
Jessica nodded.
Spreading away in front of her stretched desert growth--bushes, cacti, tiny
clumps of leaves--all trembling in the moonlight. The ringwalls were dark to her
left, moonfrosted on her right.
"This must be a Fremen place," Paul said.
"There would have to be people for this many plants to survive," she agreed.
She uncapped the tube to her stillsuit's catchpockets, sipped at it. Warm,
faintly acrid wetness slipped down her throat. She marked how it refreshed her.
The tube's cap grated against flakes of sand as she replaced it.
Movement caught Paul's attention--to his right and down on the basin floor
curving out beneath them. He stared down through smoke bushes and weeds into a
wedged slab sand-surface of moonlight inhabited by an up-hop, jump, pop-hop of
tiny motion.
"Mice!" he hissed.
Pop-hop-hop! they went, into shadows and out.

Something fell soundlessly past their eyes into the mice. There came a thin
screech, a flapping of wings, and a ghostly gray bird lifted away across the
basin with a small, dark shadow in its talons.
We needed that reminder, Jessica thought.
Paul continued to stare across the basin. He inhaled, sensed the softly
cutting contralto smell of sage climbing the night. The predatory bird--he
thought of it as the way of this desert. It had brought a stillness to the basin
so unuttered that the blue-milk moonlight could almost be heard flowing across
sentinel saguaro and spiked paintbrush. There was a low humming of light here
more basic in its harmony than any other music in his universe.
"We'd better find a place to pitch the tent," he said. "Tomorrow we can try
to find the Fremen who--"
"Most intruders here regret finding the Fremen!"
It was a heavy masculine voice chopping across his words, shattering the
moment. The voice came from above them and to their right.
"Please do not run, intruders," the voice said as Paul made to withdraw into
the defile. "If you run you'll only waste your body's water."
They want us for the water of our flesh! Jessica thought. Her muscles
overrode all fatigue, flowed into maximum readiness without external betrayal.
She pinpointed the location of the voice, thinking: Such stealth! I didn't hear
him. And she realized that the owner of that voice had permitted himself only
the small sounds, the natural sounds of the desert.
Another voice called from the basin's rim to their left. "Make it quick,
Stil. Get their water and let's be on our way. We've little enough time before
dawn."
Paul, less conditioned to emergency response than his mother, felt chagrin
that he had stiffened and tried to withdraw, that he had clouded his abilities
by a momentary panic. He forced himself now to obey her teachings: relax, than
fall into the semblance of relaxation, then into the arrested whipsnap of
muscles that can slash in any direction.
Still, he felt the edge of fear within him and knew its source. This was
blind time, no future he had seen . . . and they were caught between wild Fremen
whose only interest was the water carried in the flesh of two unshielded bodies.
= = = = = =
This Fremen religious adaptation, then, is the source of what we now recognize
as "The Pillars of the Universe," whose Qizara Tafwid are among us all with
signs and proofs and prophecy. They bring us the Arrakeen mystical fusion whose
profound beauty is typified by the stirring music built on the old forms, but
stamped with the new awakening. Who has not heard and been deeply moved by "The
Old Man's Hymn"?
I drove my feet through a desert
Whose mirage fluttered like a host.
Voracious for glory, greedy for danger,
I roamed the horizons of al-Kulab,
Watching time level mountains
In its search and its hunger for me.
And I saw the sparrows swiftly approach,
Bolder than the onrushing wolf.
They spread in the tree of my youth.
I heard the flock in my branches
And was caught on their beaks and claws!
-from "Arrakis Awakening" by the Princess Irulan
The man crawled across a dunetop. He was a mote caught in the glare of the
noon sun. He was dressed only in torn remnants of a jubba cloak, his skin bare
to the heat through the tatters. The hood had been ripped from the cloak, but
the man had fashioned a turban from a torn strip of cloth. Wisps of sandy hair
protruded from it, matched by a sparse beard and thick brows. Beneath the bluewithin-blue eyes, remains of a dark stain spread down to his cheeks. A matted
depression across mustache and beard showed where a stillsuit tube had marked
out its path from nose to catchpockets.
The man stopped half across the dunecrest, arms stretched down the slipface.
Blood had clotted on his back and on his arms and legs. Patches of yellow-gray
sand clung to the wounds. Slowly, he brought his hands under him, pushed himself
to his feet, stood there swaying. And even in this almost-random action there
remained a trace of once-precise movement.
"I am Liet-Kynes," he said, addressing himself to the empty horizon, and his
voice was a hoarse caricature of the strength it had known. "I am His Imperial
Majesty's Planetologist," he whispered, "planetary ecologist for Arrakis. I am
steward of this land."
He stumbled, fell sideways along the crusty surface of the windward face.
His hands dug feebly into the sand.
I am steward of this sand, he thought.
He realized that he was semi-delirious, that he should dig himself into the
sand, find the relatively cool underlayer and cover himself with it. But he
could still smell the rank, semisweet esters of a pre-spice pocket somewhere
underneath this sand. He knew the peril within this fact more certainly than any
other Fremen. If he could smell the pre-spice mass, that meant the gasses deep
under the sand were nearing explosive pressure. He had to get away from here.
His hands made weak scrabbling motions along the dune face.
A thought spread across his mind--clear, distinct: The real wealth of a
planet is in its landscape, how we take part in that basic source of
civilization--agriculture.
And he thought how strange it was that the mind, long fixed on a single
track, could not get off that track. The Harkonnen troopers had left him here
without water or stillsuit, thinking a worm would get him if the desert didn't.
They had thought it amusing to leave him alive to die by inches at the
impersonal hands of his planet.
The Harkonnens always did find it difficult to kill Fremen, he thought. We
don't die easily. I should be dead now . . . I will be dead soon . . . but I
can't stop being an ecologist.
"The highest function of ecology is understanding consequences."
The voice shocked him because he recognized it and knew the owner of it was
dead. It was the voice of his father who had been planetologist here before him-his father long dead, killed in the cave-in at Plaster Basin.
"Got yourself into quite a fix here, Son," his father said. "You should've
known the consequences of trying to help the child of that Duke."
I'm delirious, Kynes thought.
The voice seemed to come from his right. Kynes scraped his face through
sand, turning to look in that direction--nothing except a curving stretch of
dune dancing with heat devils in the full glare of the sun.
"The more life there is within a system, the more niches there are for
life," his father said. And the voice came now from his left, from behind him.
Why does he keep moving around? Kynes asked himself. Doesn't he want me to
see him?
"Life improves the capacity of the environment to sustain life," his father
said. "Life makes needed nutrients more readily available. It binds more energy
into the system through the tremendous chemical interplay from organism to
organism."
Why does he keep harping on the same subject? Kynes asked himself. I knew
that before I was ten.

Desert hawks, carrion-eaters in this land as were most wild creatures, began
to circle over him. Kynes saw a shadow pass near his hand, forced his head
farther around to look upward. The birds were a blurred patch on silver-blue
sky--distant flecks of soot floating above him.
"We are generalists," his father said. "You can't draw neat lines around
planet-wide problems. Planetology is a cut-and-fit science."
What's he trying to tell me? Kynes wondered. Is there some consequence I
failed to see?
His cheek slumped back against the hot sand, and he smelled the burned rock
odor beneath the pre-spice gasses. From some corner of logic in his mind, a
thought formed: Those are carrion-eater birds over me. Perhaps some of my Fremen
will see them and come to investigate.
"To the working planetologist, his most important tool is human beings," his
father said. "You must cultivate ecological, literacy among the people. That's
why I've created this entirely new form of ecological notation."
He's repeating things he said to me when I was a child, Kynes thought.
He began to feel cool, but that corner of logic in his mind told him: The
sun is overhead. You have no stillsuit and you're hot; the sun is burning the
moisture out of your body.
His fingers clawed feebly at the sand.
They couldn't even leave me a stillsuit!
"The presence of moisture in the air helps prevent too-rapid evaporation
from living bodies," his father said.
Why does he keep repeating the obvious? Kynes wondered.
He tried to think of moisture in the air--grass covering this dune . . .
open water somewhere beneath him, a long qanat flowing with water open to the
sky except in text illustrations. Open water . . . irrigation water . . . it
took five thousand cubic meters of water to irrigate one hectare of land per
growing season, he remembered.
"Our first goal on Arrakis," his father said, "is grassland provinces. We
will start with these mutated poverty grasses. When we have moisture locked in
grasslands, we'll move on to start upland forests, then a few open bodies of
water--small at first--and situated along lines of prevailing winds with
windtrap moisture precipitators spaced in the lines to recapture what the wind
steals. We must create a true sirocco--a moist wind--but we will never get away
from the necessity for windtraps."
Always lecturing me, Kynes thought. Why doesn't he shut up? Can't he see I'm
dying?
"You will die, too," his father said, "if you don't get off the bubble
that's forming right now deep underneath you. It's there and you know it. You
can smell the pre-spice gasses. You know the little makers are beginning to lose
some of their water into the mass."
The thought of that water beneath him was maddening. He imagined it now-sealed off in strata of porous rock by the leathery half-plant, half-animal
little makers--and the thin rupture that was pouring a cool stream of clearest,
pure, liquid, soothing water into . . .
A pre-spice mass!
He inhaled, smelling the rank sweetness. The odor was much richer around him
than it had been.
Kynes pushed himself to his knees, heard a bird screech, the hurried
flapping of wings.
This is spice desert, he thought. There must be Fremen about even in the day
sun. Surely they can see the birds and will investigate.
"Movement across the landscape is a necessity for animal life," his father
said. "Nomad peoples follow the same necessity. Lines of movement adjust to
physical needs for water, food, minerals. We must control this movement now,
align it for our purposes."
"Shut up, old man," Kynes muttered.
"We must do a thing on Arrakis never before attempted for an entire planet,"
his father said. "We must use man as a constructive ecological force--inserting
adapted terraform life: a plant here, an animal there, a man in that place--to
transform the water cycle, to build a new kind of landscape."
"Shut up!" Kynes croaked.
"It was lines of movement that gave us the first clue to the relationship
between worms and spice," his father said.
A worm, Kynes thought with a surge of hope. A maker's sure to come when this
bubble bursts. But I have no hooks. How can I mount a big maker without hooks?
He could feel frustration sapping what little strength remained to him.
Water so near--only a hundred meters or so beneath him; a worm sure to come, but
no way to trap it on the surface and use it.
Kynes pitched forward onto the sand, returning to the shallow depression his
movements had defined. He felt sand hot against his left cheek, but the
sensation was remote.
"The Arrakeen environment built itself into the evolutionary pattern of
native life forms," his father said. "How strange that so few people ever looked
up from the spice long enough to wonder at the near-ideal nitrogen-oxygen-CO2
balance being maintained here in the absence of large areas of plant cover. The
energy sphere of the planet is there to see and understand--a relentless
process, but a process nonetheless. There is a gap in it? Then something
occupies that gap. Science is made up of so many things that appear obvious
after they are explained. I knew the little maker was there, deep in the sand,
long before I ever saw it."
"Please stop lecturing me, Father," Kynes whispered.
A hawk landed on the sand near his outstretched hand. Kynes saw it fold its
wings, tip its head to stare at him. He summoned the energy to croak at it. The
bird hopped away two steps, but continued to stare at him.
"Men and their works have been a disease on the surface of their planets
before now," his father said. "Nature tends to compensate for diseases, to
remove or encapsulate them, to incorporate them into the system in her own way."
The hawk lowered its head, stretched its wings, refolded them. It
transferred its attention to his outstretched hand.
Kynes found that he no longer had the strength to croak at it.
"The historical system of mutual pillage and extortion stops here on
Arrakis," his father said. "You cannot go on forever stealing what you need
without regard to those who come after. The physical qualities of a planet are
written into its economic and political record. We have the record in front of
us and our course is obvious."
He never could stop lecturing, Kynes thought. Lecturing, lecturing,
lecturing--always lecturing.
The hawk hopped one step closer to Kynes' outstretched hand, turned its head
first one way and then the other to study the exposed flesh.
"Arrakis is a one-crop planet," his father said. "One crop. It supports a
ruling class that lives as ruling classes have lived in all times while, beneath
them, a semihuman mass of semislaves exists on the leavings. It's the masses and
the leavings that occupy our attention. These are far more valuable than has
ever been suspected."
"I'm ignoring you, Father," Kynes whispered. "Go away."
And he thought: Surely there must be some of my Fremen near. They cannot
help but see the birds over me. They will investigate if only to see if there's
moisture available.
"The masses of Arrakis will know that we work to make the land flow with
water," his father said. "Most of them, of course, will have only a semimystical
understanding of how we intend to do this. Many, not understanding the
prohibitive mass-ratio problem, may even think we'll bring water from some other
planet rich in it. Let them think anything they wish as long as they believe in
us."
In a minute I'll get up and tell him what I think of him, Kynes thought.
Standing there lecturing me when he should be helping me.
The bird took another hop closer to Kynes' outstretched hand. Two more hawks
drifted down to the sand behind it.
"Religion and law among our masses must be one and the same," his father
said. "An act of disobedience must be a sin and require religious penalties.
This will have the dual benefit of bringing both greater obedience and greater
bravery. We must depend not so much on the bravery of individuals, you see, as
upon the bravery of a whole population."
Where is my population now when I need it most? Kynes thought. He summoned
all his strength, moved his hand a finger's width toward the nearest hawk. It
hopped backward among its companions and all stood poised for flight.
"Our timetable, will achieve the stature of a natural phenomenon," his
father said. "A planet's life is a vast, tightly interwoven fabric. Vegetation
and animal changes will be determined at first by the raw physical forces we
manipulate. As they establish themselves, though, our changes will become
controlling influences in their own right--and we will have to deal with them,
too. Keep in mind, though, that we need control only three per cent of the
energy surface--only three per cent--to tip the entire structure over into our
self-sustaining system."
Why aren't you helping we? Kynes wondered. Always the same: when I need you
most, you fail me. He wanted to turn his head, to stare in the direction of his
father's voice, stare the old man down. Muscles refused to answer his demand.
Kynes saw the hawk move. It approached his hand, a cautious step at a time
while its companions waited in mock indifference. The hawk stopped only a hop
away from his hand.
A profound clarity filled Kynes' mind. He saw quite suddenly a potential for
Arrakis that his father had never seen. The possibilities along that different
path flooded through him.
"No more terrible disaster could befall your people than for them to fall
into the hands of a Hero," his father said.
Reading my mind! Kynes thought. Well . . . let him.
The messages already have been sent to my sietch villages, he thought.
Nothing can stop them. If the Duke's son is alive they'll find him and protect
him as I have commanded. They may discard the woman, his mother, but they'll
save the boy.
The hawk took one hop that brought it within slashing distance of his hand.
It tipped its head to examine the supine flesh. Abruptly, it straightened,
stretched its head upward and with a single screech, leaped into the air and
banked away overhead with its companions behind it.
They've come! Kynes thought. My Fremen have found me!
Then he heard the sand rumbling.
Every Fremen knew the sound, could distinguish it immediately from the
noises of worms or other desert life. Somewhere beneath him, the pre-spice mass
had accumulated enough water and organic matter from the little makers, had
reached the critical stage of wild growth. A gigantic bubble of carbon dioxide
was forming deep in the sand, heaving upward in an enormous "blow" with a dust
whirlpool at its center. It would exchange what had been formed deep in the sand
for whatever lay on the surface.
The hawks circled overhead screeching their frustration. They knew what was
happening. Any desert creature would know.
And I am a desert creature, Kynes thought. You see me, Father? I am a desert
creature.
He felt the bubble lift him, felt it break and the dust whirlpool engulf
him, dragging him down into cool darkness. For a moment, the sensation of
coolness and the moisture were blessed relief. Then, as his planet killed him,
it occurred to Kynes that his father and all the other scientists were wrong,
that the most persistent principles of the universe were accident and error.
Even the hawks could appreciate these facts.

Prophecy and prescience--How can they be put to the test in the face of the
unanswered questions? Consider: How much is actual prediction of the "waveform"
(as Muad'Dib referred to his vision-image) and how much is the prophet shaping
the future to fit the prophecy? What of the harmonics inherent in the act of
prophecy? Does the prophet see the future or does he see a line of weakness, a
fault or cleavage that he may shatter with words or decisions as a diamondcutter shatters his gem with a blow of a knife?
-"Private Reflections on Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
"Get their water," the man calling out of the night had said. And Paul
fought down his fear, glanced at his mother. His trained eyes saw her readiness
for battle, the waiting whipsnap of her muscles.
"It would be regrettable should we have to destroy you out of hand," the
voice above them said.
That's the one who spoke to us first, Jessica thought. There are at least
two of them--one to our right and one on our left.
"Cignoro hrobosa sukares hin mange la pchagavas doi me kamavas na beslas
lele pal hrobas!"
It was the man to their right calling out across the basin.
To Paul, the words were gibberish, but out of her Bene Gesserit training,
Jessica recognized the speech. It was Chakobsa, one of the ancient hunting
languages, and the man above them was saying that perhaps these were the
strangers they sought.
In the sudden silence that followed the calling voice, the hoop-wheel face
of the second moon--faintly ivory blue--rolled over the rocks across the basin,
bright and peering.
Scrambling sounds came from the rocks--above and to both sides . . . dark
motions in the moonlight. Many figures flowed through the shadows.
A whole troop! Paul thought with a sudden pang.
A tall man in a mottled burnoose stepped in front of Jessica. His mouth
baffle was thrown aside for clear speech, revealing a heavy beard in the
sidelight of the moon, but face and eyes were hidden in the overhang of his
hood.
"What have we here--jinn or human?" he asked.
And Jessica heard the true-banter in his voice, she allowed herself a faint
hope. This was the voice of command, the voice that had first shocked them with
its intrusion from the night.
"Human, I warrant," the man said.
Jessica sensed rather than saw the knife hidden in a fold of the man's robe.
She permitted herself one bitter regret that she and Paul had no shields.
"Do you also speak?" the man asked.
Jessica put all the royal arrogance at her command into her manner and
voice. Reply was urgent, but she had not heard enough of this man to be certain
she had a register on his culture and weaknesses.
"Who comes on us like criminals out of the night?" she demanded.
The burnoose-hooded head showed tension in a sudden twist, then slow
relaxation that revealed much. The man had good control.
Paul shifted away from his mother to separate them as targets and give each
of them a clearer arena of action.

The hooded head turned at Paul's movement, opening a wedge of face to
moonlight. Jessica saw a sharp nose, one glinting eye--dark, so dark the eye,
without any white in it--a heavy brown and upturned mustache.
"A likely cub," the man said. "If you're fugitives from the Harkonnens, it
may be you're welcome among us. What is it, boy?"
The possibilities flashed through Paul's mind: A trick? A fact? Immediate
decision was needed.
"Why should you welcome fugitives?" he demanded.
"A child who thinks and speaks like a man," the tall man said. "Well, now,
to answer your question, my young wali, I am one who does not pay the fai, the
water tribute, to the Harkonnens. That is why I might welcome a fugitive."
He knows who we are, Paul thought. There's concealment in his voice.
"I am Stilgar, the Fremen," the tall man said. "Does that speed your tongue,
boy?"
It is the same voice, Paul thought. And he remembered the Council with this
man seeking the body of a friend slain by the Harkonnens.
"I know you, Stilgar," Paul said. "I was with my father in Council when you
came for the water of your friend. You took away with you my father's man,
Duncan Idaho--an exchange of friends."
"And Idaho abandoned us to return to his Duke," Stilgar said.
Jessica heard the shading of disgust in his voice, held herself prepared for
attack.
The voice from the rocks above them called: "We waste time here, Stil."
"This is the Duke's son," Stilgar barked. "He's certainly the one Liet told
us to seek."
"But . . . a child, Stil."
"The Duke was a man and this lad used a thumper," Stilgar said. "That was a
brave crossing he made in the path of shai-hulud. "
And Jessica heard him excluding her from his thoughts. Had he already passed
sentence?
"We haven't time for the test," the voice above them protested.
"Yet he could be the Lisan al-Gaib," Stilgar said.
He's looking for an omen! Jessica thought.
"But the woman," the voice above them said.
Jessica readied herself anew. There had been death in that voice.
"Yes, the woman," Stilgar said. "And her water."
"You know the law," said the voice from the rocks. "Ones who cannot live
with the desert--"
"Be quiet," Stilgar said. "Times change."
"Did Liet command this?" asked the voice from the rocks.
"You heard the voice of the cielago, Jamis," Stilgar said. "Why do you press
me?"
And Jessica thought: Cielago! the clue of the tongue opened wide avenues of
understanding: this was the language of Ilm and Fiqh, and cielago meant bat, a
small flying mammal. Voice of the cielago: they had received a distrans message
to seek Paul and herself.
"I but remind you of your duties, friend Stilgar," said the voice above
them.
"My duty is the strength of the tribe," Stilgar said. "That is my only duty.
I need no one to remind me of it. This child-man interests me. He is fullfleshed. He has lived on much water. He has lived away from the father sun. He
has not the eyes of the ibad. Yet he does not speak or act like a weakling of
the pans. Nor did his father. How can this be?"
"We cannot stay out here all night arguing," said the voice from the rocks.
"If a patrol--"
"I will not tell you again, Jamis, to be quiet," Stilgar said.

The man above them remained silent, but Jessica heard him moving, crossing
by a leap over a defile and working his way down to the basin floor on their
left.
"The voice of the cielago suggested there'd be value to us in saving you
two," Stilgar said. "I can see possibility in this strong boy-man: he is young
and can learn. But what of yourself, woman?" He stared at Jessica.
I have his voice and pattern registered now, Jessica thought. I could
control him with a word, but he's a strong man . . . worth much more to us
unblunted and with full freedom of action. We shall see.
"I am the mother of this boy," Jessica said. "In part, his strength which
you admire is the product of my training."
"The strength of a woman can be boundless," Stilgar said. "Certain it is in
a Reverend Mother. Are you a Reverend Mother?"
For the moment, Jessica put aside the implications of the question, answered
truthfully, "No."
"Are you trained in the ways of the desert?"
"No, but many consider my training valuable."
"We make our own judgments on value," Stilgar said.
"Every man has the right to his own judgments," she said.
"It is well that you see the reason," Stilgar said. "We cannot dally here to
test you, woman. Do you understand? We'd not want your shade to plague us. I
will take the boy-man, your son, and he shall have my countenance, sanctuary in
my tribe. But for you, woman--you understand there is nothing personal in this?
It is the rule, Istislah, in the general interest. Is that not enough?"
Paul took a half-step forward. "What are you talking about?"
Stilgar flicked a glance across Paul, but kept his attention on Jessica.
"Unless you've been deep-trained from childhood to live here, you could bring
destruction onto an entire tribe. It is the law, and we cannot carry useless . .
. "
Jessica's motion started as a slumping, deceptive faint to the ground. It
was the obvious thing for a weak outworlder to do, and the obvious slows an
opponent's reactions. It takes an instant to interpret a known thing when that
thing is exposed as something unknown. She shifted as she saw his right shoulder
drop to bring a weapon within the folds of his robe to bear on her new position.
A turn, a slash of her arm, a whirling of mingled robes, and she was against the
rocks with the man helpless in front of her.
At his mother's first movement, Paul backed two steps. As she attacked, he
dove for shadows. A bearded man rose up in his path, half-crouched, lunging
forward with a weapon in one hand. Paul took the man beneath the sternum with a
straight-hand jab, sidestepped and chopped the base of his neck, relieving him
of the weapon as he fell.
Then Paul was into the shadows, scrambling upward among the rocks, the
weapon tucked into his waist sash. He had recognized it in spite of its
unfamiliar shape--a projectile weapon, and that said many things about this
place, another clue that shields were not used here.
They will concentrate on my mother and that Stilgar fellow. She can handle
him. I must get to a safe vantage point where I can threaten them and give her
time to escape.
There came a chorus of sharp spring-clicks from the basin. Projectiles
whined off the rocks around him. One of them flicked his robe. He squeezed
around a corner in the rocks, found himself in a narrow vertical crack, began
inching upward--his back against one side, his feet against the other--slowly,
as silently as he could.
The roar of Stilgar's voice echoed up to him: "Get back, you wormheaded
lice! She'll break my neck if you come near!"
A voice out of the basin said: "The boy got away, Stil. What are we--"
"Of course he got away, you sand-brained . . . Ugh-h-h! Easy, woman!"
"Tell them to stop hunting my son," Jessica said.
"They've stopped, woman. He got away as you intended him to. Great gods
below! Why didn't you say you were a weirding woman and a fighter?"
"Tell your men to fall back," Jessica said. "Tell them to go out into the
basin where I can see them . . . and you'd better believe that I know how many
of them there are."
And she thought: This is the delicate moment, but if this man is as sharpminded as I think him, we have a chance.
Paul inched his way upward, found a narrow ledge on which he could rest and
look down into the basin. Stilgar's voice came up to him.
"And if I refuse? How can you . . . ugh-h-h! Leave be, woman! We mean no
harm to you, now. Great gods! If you can do this to the strongest of us, you're
worth ten times your weight of water."
Now, the test of reason, Jessica thought. She said: "You ask after the Lisan
al-Gaib."
"You could be the folk of the legend," he said, "but I'll believe that when
it's been tested. All I know now is that you came here with that stupid Duke who
. . . Aiee-e-e! Woman! I care not if you kill me! He was honorable and brave,
but it was stupid to put himself in the way of the Harkonnen fist!"
Silence.
Presently, Jessica said: "He had no choice, but we'll not argue it. Now,
tell that man of yours behind the bush over there to stop trying to bring his
weapon to bear on me, or I'll rid the universe of you and take him next."
"You there!" Stilgar roared. "Do as she says!"
"But, Stil--"
"Do as she says, you wormfaced, crawling, sand-brained piece of lizard turd!
Do it or I'll help her dismember you! Can't you see the worth of this woman?"
The man at the bush straightened from his partial concealment, lowered his
weapon.
"He has obeyed," Stilgar said.
"Now," Jessica said, "explain clearly to your people what it is you wish of
me. I want no young hothead to make a foolish mistake."
"When we slip into the villages and towns we must mask our origin, blend
with the pan and graben folk," Stilgar said. "We carry no weapons, for the
crysknife is sacred. But you, woman, you have the weirding ability of battle.
We'd only heard of it and many doubted, but one cannot doubt what he sees with
his own eyes. You mastered an armed Fremen. This is a weapon no search could
expose."
There was a stirring in the basin as Stilgar's words sank home.
"And if I agree to teach you the . . . weirding way?"
"My countenance for you as well as your son."
"How can we be sure of the truth in your promise?"
Stilgar's voice lost some of its subtle undertone of reasoning, took on an
edge of bitterness. "Out here, woman, we carry no paper for contracts. We make
no evening promises to be broken at dawn. When a man says a thing, that's the
contract. As leader of my people, I've put them in bond to my word. Teach us
this weirding way and you have sanctuary with us as long as you wish. Your water
shall mingle with our water."
"Can you speak for all Fremen?" Jessica asked.
"In time, that may be. But only my brother, Liet, speaks for all Fremen.
Here, I promise only secrecy. My people will not speak of you to any other
sietch. The Harkonnens have returned to Dune in force and your Duke is dead. It
is said that you two died in a Mother storm. The hunter does not seek dead
game."
There's safety in that, Jessica thought. But these people have good
communications and a message could be sent.
"I presume there was a reward offered for us," she said.

Stilgar remained silent, and she could almost see the thoughts turning over
in his head, sensing the shifts of his muscles beneath her hands.
Presently, he said: "I will say it once more: I've given the tribe's wordbond. My people know your worth to us now. What could the Harkonnens give us?
Our freedom? Hah! no, you are the taqwa, that which buys us more than all the
spice in the Harkonnen coffers."
"Then I shall teach you my way of battle," Jessica said, and she sensed the
unconscious ritual-intensity of her own words.
"Now, will you release me?"
"So be it," Jessica said. She released her hold on him, stepped aside in
full view of the bank in the basin. This is the test-mashed, she thought. But
Paul must know about them even if I die for his knowledge.
In the waiting silence, Paul inched forward to get a better view of where
his mother stood. As he moved, he heard heavy breathing, suddenly stilled, above
him in the vertical crack of the rock, and sensed a faint shadow there outlined
against the stars.
Stilgar's voice came up from the basin: "You, up there! Stop hunting the
boy. He'll come down presently."
The voice of a young boy or a girl sounded from the darkness above Paul:
"But, Stil, he can't be far from--"
"I said leave him be, Chani! You spawn of a lizard!"
There came a whispered imprecation from above Paul and a low voice: "Call me
spawn of a lizard!" But the shadow pulled back out of view.
Paul returned his attention to the basin, picking out the gray-shadowed
movement of Stilgar beside his mother.
"Come in, all of you," Stilgar called. He turned to Jessica. "And now I'll
ask you how we may be certain you'll fulfill your half of our bargain? You're
the one's lived with papers and empty contracts and such as--"
"We of the Bene Gesserit don't break our vows any more than you do," Jessica
said.
There was a protracted silence, then a multiple hissing of voices: "A Bene
Gesserit witch!"
Paul brought his captured weapon from his sash, trained it on the dark
figure of Stilgar, but the man and his companions remained immobile, staring at
Jessica.
"It is the legend," someone said.
"It was said that the Shadout Mapes gave this report on you," Stilgar said.
"But a thing so important must be tested. If you are the Bene Gesserit of the
legend whose son will lead us to paradise . . . " He shrugged.
Jessica sighed, thinking: So our Missionaria Protectiva even planted
religious safety valves all through this hell hole. Ah, well . . . it'll help,
and that's what it was meant to do.
She said: "The seeress who brought you the legend, she gave it under the
binding of karama and ijaz, the miracle and the inimitability of the prophecy-this I know. Do you wish a sign?"
His nostrils flared in the moonlight. "We cannot tarry for the rites," he
whispered.
Jessica recalled a chart Kynes had shown her while arranging emergency
escape routes. How long ago it seemed. There had been a place called "Sietch
Tabr" on the chart and beside it the notation: "Stilgar."
"Perhaps when we get to Sietch Tabr," she said.
The revelation shook him, and Jessica thought: If only he knew the tricks we
use! She must've been good, that Bene Gesserit of the Missionaria Protectiva.
These Fremen are beautifully prepared to believe in us.
Stilgar shifted uneasily. "We must go now."
She nodded, letting him know that they left with her permission.

He looked up at the cliff almost directly at the rock ledge where Paul
crouched. "You there, lad: you may come down now." He returned his attention to
Jessica, spoke with an apologetic tone: "Your son made an incredible amount of
noise climbing. He has much to learn lest he endanger us all, but he's young."
"No doubt we have much to teach each other," Jessica said. "Meanwhile, you'd
best see to your companion out there. My noisy son was a bit rough in disarming
him."
Stilgar whirled, his hood flapping. "Where?"
"Beyond those bushes." She pointed.
Stilgar touched two of his men. "See to it." He glanced at his companions,
identifying them. "Jamis is missing." He turned to Jessica. "Even your cub knows
the weirding way."
"And you'll notice that my son hasn't stirred from up there as you ordered,"
Jessica said.
The two men Stilgar had sent returned supporting a third who stumbled and
gasped between them. Stilgar gave them a flicking glance, returned his attention
to Jessica. "The son will take only your orders, eh? Good. He knows discipline."
"Paul, you may come down now," Jessica said.
Paul stood up, emerging into moonlight above his concealing cleft, slipped
the Fremen weapon back into his sash. As he turned, another figure arose from
the rocks to face him.
In the moonlight and reflection off gray stone, Paul saw a small figure in
Fremen robes, a shadowed face peering out at him from the hood, and the muzzle
of one of the projectile weapons aimed at him from a fold of robe.
"I am Chani, daughter of Liet."
The voice was lilting, half filled with laughter.
"I would not have permitted you to harm my companions," she said.
Paul swallowed. The figure in front of him turned into the moon's path and
he saw an elfin face, black pits of eyes. The familiarity of that face, the
features out of numberless visions in his earliest prescience, shocked Paul to
stillness. He remembered the angry bravado with which he had once described this
face-from-a-dream, telling the Reverend Mother Gains Helen Mohiam: "I will meet
her."
And here was the face, but in no meeting he had ever dreamed.
"You were as noisy as shai-hulud in a rage," she said. "And you took the
most difficult way up here. Follow me; I'll show you an easier way down."
He scrambled out of the cleft, followed the swirling of her robe across a
tumbled landscape. She moved like a gazelle, dancing over the rocks. Paul felt
hot blood in his face, was thankful for the darkness.
That girl! She was like a touch of destiny. He felt caught up on a wave, in
tune with a motion that lifted all his spirits.
They stood presently amidst the Fremen on the basin floor.
Jessica turned a wry smile on Paul, but spoke to Stilgar: "This will be a
good exchange of teachings. I hope you and your people feel no anger at our
violence. It seemed . . . necessary. You were about to . . . make a mistake."
"To save one from a mistake is a gift of paradise," Stilgar said. He touched
his lips with his left hand, lifted the weapon from Paul's waist with the other,
tossed it to a companion. "You will have your own maula pistol, lad, when you've
earned it."
Paul started to speak, hesitated, remembering his mother's teaching:
"Beginnings are such delicate times. "
"My son has what weapons he needs," Jessica said. She stared at Stilgar,
forcing him to think of how Paul had acquired the pistol.
Stilgar glanced at the man Paul had subdued--Jamis. The man stood at one
side, head lowered, breathing heavily. "You are a difficult woman," Stilgar
said. He held out his left hand to a companion, snapped his fingers. "Kushti
bakka te."
More Chakobsa, Jessica thought.
The companion pressed two squares of gauze into Stilgar's hand. Stilgar ran
them through his fingers, fixed one around Jessica's neck beneath her hood,
fitted the other around Paul's neck in the same way.
"Now you wear the kerchief of the bakka," he said. "If we become separated,
you will be recognized as belonging to Stilgar's sietch. We will talk of weapons
another time."
He moved out through his band now, inspecting them, giving Paul's Fremkit
pack to one of his men to carry.
Bakka, Jessica thought, recognizing the religious term: bakka--the weeper.
She sensed how the symbolism of the kerchiefs united this band. Why should
weeping unite them? she asked herself.
Stilgar came to the young girl who had embarrassed Paul, said: "Chani, take
the child-man under your wing. Keep him out of trouble."
Chani touched Paul's arm. "Come along, child-man."
Paul hid the anger in his voice, said: "My name is Paul. It were well you--"
"We'll give you a name, manling," Stilgar said, "in the time of the mihna,
at the test of aql."
The test of reason, Jessica translated. The sudden need of Paul's ascendancy
overrode all other consideration, and she barked, "My son's been tested with the
gom jabbar!"
In the stillness that followed, she knew she had struck to the heart of
them.
"There's much we don't know of each other," Stilgar said. "But we tarry
overlong. Day-sun mustn't find us in the open." He crossed to the man Paul had
struck down, said, "Jamis, can you travel?"
A grunt answered him. "Surprised me, he did. 'Twas an accident. I can
travel."
"No accident," Stilgar said. "I'll hold you responsible with Chani for the
lad's safety, Jamis. These people have my countenance."
Jessica stared at the man, Jamis. His was the voice that had argued with
Stilgar from the rocks. His was the voice with death in it. And Stilgar had seen
fit to reinforce his order with this Jamis.
Stilgar flicked a testing glance across the group, motioned two men out.
"Larus and Farrukh, you are to hide our tracks. See that we leave no trace.
Extra care--we have two with us who've not been trained." He turned, hand upheld
and aimed across the basin. "In squad line with flankers--move out. We must be
at Cave of the Ridges before dawn."
Jessica fell into step beside Stilgar, counting heads. There were forty
Fremen--she and Paul made it forty-two. And she thought: They travel as a
military company--even the girl, Chani.
Paul took a place in the line behind Chani. He had put down the black
feeling at being caught by the girl. In his mind now was the memory called up by
his mother's barked reminder: "My son's been tested with the gom jabbar!" He
found that his hand tingled with remembered pain.
"Watch where you go," Chani hissed. "Do not brush against a bush lest you
leave a thread to show our passage."
Paul swallowed, nodded.
Jessica listened to the sounds of the troop, hearing her own footsteps and
Paul's, marveling at the way the Fremen moved. They were forty people crossing
the basin with only the sounds natural to the place--ghostly feluccas, their
robes flitting through the shadows. Their destination was Sietch Tabr--Stilgar's
sietch.
She turned the word over in her mind; sietch. It was a Chakobsa word,
unchanged from the old hunting language out of countless centuries. Sietch: a
meeting place in time of danger. The profound implications of the word and the
language were just beginning to register with her after the tension of their
encounter.
"We move well," Stilgar said. "With, Shai-hulud's favor, we'll reach Cave of
the Ridges before dawn."
Jessica nodded, conserving her strength, sensing the terrible fatigue she
held at bay by force of will . . . and, she admitted it: by the force of
elation. Her mind focused on the value of this troop, seeing what was revealed
here about the Fremen culture.
All of them, she thought, an entire culture trained to military order. What
a priceless thing is here for an outcast Duke!

The Fremen were supreme in that quality the ancients called "spannungsbogen"-which is the self-imposed delay between desire for a thing and the act of
reaching out to grasp that thing.

They approached Cave of the Ridges at dawnbreak, moving through a split in
the basin wall so narrow they had to turn sideways to negotiate it. Jessica saw
Stilgar detach guards in the thin dawnlight, saw them for a moment as they began
their scrambling climb up the cliff.
Paul turned his head upward as he walked, seeing the tapestry of this planet
cut in cross section where the narrow cleft gaped toward gray-blue sky.
Chani pulled at his robe to hurry him, said: "Quickly. It is already light."
"The men who climbed above us, where are they going?" Paul whispered.
"The first daywatch," she said. "Hurry now!"
A guard left outside, Paul thought. Wise. But it would've been wiser still
for us to approach this place in separate bands. Less chance of losing the whole
troop. He paused in the thought, realizing that this was guerrilla thinking, and
he remembered his father's fear that the Atreides might become a guerrilla
house.
"Faster," Chani whispered.
Paul sped his steps, hearing the swish of robes behind. And he thought of
the words of the sirat from Yueh's tiny 0.C. Bible.
"Paradise on my right, Hell on my left and the Angel of Death behind." He
rolled the quotation in his mind.
They rounded a corner where the passage widened. Stilgar stood at one side
motioning them into a low hole that opened at right angles.
"Quickly!" he hissed. "We're like rabbits in a cage if a patrol catches us
here."
Paul bent for the opening, followed Chani into a cave illuminated by thin
gray light from somewhere ahead.
"You can stand up," she said.
He straightened, studied the place: a deep and wide area with domed ceiling
that curved away just out of a man's handreach. The troop spread out through
shadows. Paul saw his mother come up on one side, saw her examine their
companions. And he noted how she failed to blend with the Fremen even though her
garb was identical. The way she moved--such a sense of power and grace.
"Find a place to rest and stay out of the way, child-man," Chani said.
"Here's food." She pressed two leaf-wrapped morsels into his hand. They reeked
of spice.
Stilgar came up behind Jessica, called an order to a group on the left. "Get
the doorseal in place and see to moisture security." He turned to another
Fremen: "Lemil, get glowglobes." He took Jessica's arm. "I wish to show you
something, weirding woman." He led her around a curve of rock toward the light
source.

Jessica found herself looking out across the wide lip of another opening to
the cave, an opening high in a cliff wall--looking out across another basin
about ten or twelve kilometers wide. The basin was shielded by high rock walls.
Sparse clumps of plant growth were scattered around it.
As she looked at the dawn-gray basin, the sun lifted over the far escarpment
illuminating a biscuit-colored landscape of rocks and sand. And she noted how
the sun of Arrakis appeared to leap over the horizon.
It's because we want to hold it back, she thought. Night is safer than day.
There came over her then a longing for a rainbow in this place that would never
see rain. I must suppress such longings, she thought. They're a weakness. I no
longer can afford weaknesses.
Stilgar gripped her arm, pointed across the basin. "There! There you see
proper Druses."
She looked where he pointed, saw movement: people on the basin floor
scattering at the daylight into the shadows of the opposite cliffwall. In spite
of the distance, their movements were plain in the clear air. She lifted her
binoculars from beneath her robe, focused the oil lenses on the distant people.
Kerchiefs fluttered like a flight of multicolored butterflies.
"That is home," Stilgar said. "We will be there this night." He stared
across the basin, tugging at his mustache. "My people stayed out overlate
working. That means there are no patrols about. I'll signal them later and
they'll prepare for us."
"Your people show good discipline," Jessica said. She lowered the
binoculars, saw that Stilgar was looking at them.
"They obey the preservation of the tribe," he said. "It is the way we choose
among us for a leader. The leader is the one who is strongest, the one who
brings water and security." He lifted his attention to her face.
She returned his stare, noted the whiteless eyes, the stained eyepits, the
dust-rimmed beard and mustache, the line of the catchtube curving down from his
nostrils into his stillsuit.
"Have I compromised your leadership by besting you, Stilgar?" she asked.
"You did not call me out," he said.
"It's important that a leader keep the respect of his troop," she said.
"Isn't a one of those sandlice I cannot handle," Stilgar said. "When you
bested me, you bested us all. Now, they hope to learn from you . . . the
weirding way . . . and some are curious to see if you intend to call me out."
She weighed the implications. "By besting you in formal battle?"
He nodded. "I'd advise you against this because they'd not follow you.
You're not of the sand. They saw this in our night's passage."
"Practical people," she said.
"True enough." He glanced at the basin. "We know our needs. But not many are
thinking deep thoughts now this close to home. We've been out overlong arranging
to deliver our spice quota to the free traders for the cursed Guild . . . may
their faces be forever black."
Jessica stopped in the act of turning away from him, looked back up into his
face. "The Guild? What has the Guild to do with your spice?"
"It's Liet's command," Stilgar said. "We know the reason, but the taste of
it sours us. We bribe the Guild with a monstrous payment in spice to keep our
skies clear of satellites and such that none may spy what we do to the face of
Arrakis."
She weighed out her words, remembering that Paul had said this must be the
reason Arrakeen skies were clear of satellites. "And what is it you do to the
face of Arrakis that must not be seen?"
"We change it . . . slowly but with certainty . . . to make it fit for human
life. Our generation will not see it, nor our children nor our children's
children nor the grandchildren of their children . . . but it will come." He
stared with veiled eyes out over the basin. "Open water and tall green plants
and people walking freely without stillsuits."
So that's the dream of this Liet-Kynes, she thought. And she said: "Bribes
are dangerous; they have a way of growing larger and larger."
"They grow," he said, "but the slow way is the safe way."
Jessica turned, looked out over the basin, trying to see it the way Stilgar
was seeing it in his imagination. She saw only the grayed mustard stain of
distant rocks and a sudden hazy motion in the sky above the cliffs.
"Ah-h-h-h," Stilgar said.
She thought at first it must be a patrol vehicle, then realized it was a
mirage--another landscape hovering over the desert-sand and a distant wavering
of greenery and in the middle distance a long worm traveling the surface with
what looked like Fremen robes fluttering on its back.
The mirage faded.
"It would be better to ride," Stilgar said, "but we cannot permit a maker
into this basin. Thus, we must walk again tonight."
Maker--their word for worm, she thought.
She measured the import of his words, the statement that they could not
permit a worm into this basin. She knew what she had seen in the mirage--Fremen
riding on the back of a giant worm. It took heavy control not to betray her
shock at the implications.
"We must be getting back to the others," Stilgar said. "Else my people may
suspect I dally with you. Some already are jealous that my hands tasted your
loveliness when we struggled last night in Tuono Basin."
"That will be enough of that!" Jessica snapped.
"No offense," Stilgar said, and his voice was mild. "Women among us are not
taken against their will . . . and with you . . . " He shrugged. ". . . even
that convention isn't required."
"You will keep in mind that I was a duke's lady," she said, but her voice
was calmer.
"As you wish," he said. "It's time to seal off this opening, to permit
relaxation of stillsuit discipline. My people need to rest in comfort this day.
Their families will give them little rest on the morrow."
Silence fell between them.
Jessica stared out into the sunlight. She had heard what she had heard in
Stilgar's voice--the unspoken offer of more than his countenance. Did he need a
wife? She realized she could step into that place with him. It would be one way
to end conflict over tribal leadership--female properly aligned with male.
But what of Paul then? Who could tell yet what rules of parenthood prevailed
here? And what of the unborn daughter she had carried these few weeks? What of a
dead Duke's daughter? And she permitted herself to face fully the significance
of this other child growing within her, to see her own motives in permitting the
conception. She knew what it was--she had succumbed to that profound drive
shared by all creatures who are faced with death--the drive to seek immortality
through progeny. The fertility drive of the species had overpowered them.
Jessica glanced at Stilgar, saw that he was studying her, waiting. A
daughter born here to a woman wed to such a one as this man--what would be the
fate of such a daughter? she asked herself. Would he try to limit the
necessities that a Bene Gesserit must follow?
Stilgar cleared his throat and revealed then that he understood some of the
questions in her mind. "What is important for a leader is that which makes him a
leader. It is the needs of his people. If you teach me your powers, there may
come a day when one of us must challenge the other. I would prefer some
alternative."
"There are several alternatives?" she asked.
"The Sayyadina," he said. "Our Reverend Mother is old."
Their Reverend Mother!

Before she could probe this, he said: "I do not necessarily offer myself as
mate. This is nothing personal, for you are beautiful and desirable. But should
you become one of my women, that might lead some of my young men to believe that
I'm too much concerned with pleasures of the flesh and not enough concerned with
the tribe's needs. Even now they listen to us and watch us."
A man who weighs his decisions, who thinks of consequences, she thought.
"There are those among my young men who have reached the age of wild
spirits," he said. "They must be eased through this period. I must leave no
great reasons around for them to challenge me. Because I would have to maim and
kill among them. This is not the proper course for a leader if it can be avoided
with honor. A leader, you see, is one of the things that distinguishes a mob
from a people. He maintains the level of individuals. Too few individuals, and a
people reverts to a mob."
His words, the depth of their awareness, the fact that he spoke as much to
her as to those who secretly listened, forced her to reevaluate him.
He has stature, she thought. Where did he learn such inner balance?
"The law that demands our form of choosing a leader is a just law," Stilgar
said. "But it does not follow that justice is always the thing a people needs.
What we truly need now is time to grow and prosper, to spread our force over
more land."
What is his ancestry? she wondered. Whence comes such breeding? She said:
"Stilgar, I underestimated you."
"Such was my suspicion," he said.
"Each of us apparently underestimated the other," she said.
"I should like an end to this," he said. "I should like friendship with you
. . . and trust. I should like that respect for each other which grows in the
breast without demand for the huddlings of sex."
"I understand," she said.
"Do you trust me?"
"I hear your sincerity."
"Among us," he said, "the Sayyadina, when they are not the formal leaders,
hold a special place of honor. They teach. They maintain the strength of God
here." He touched his breast.
Now I must probe this Reverend Mother mystery, she thought. And she said:
"You spoke of your Reverend Mother . . . and I've heard words of legend and
prophecy."
"It is said that a Bene Gesserit and her offspring hold the key to our
future," he said.
"Do you believe I am that one."
She watched his face, thinking; The young reed dies so easily. Beginnings
are times of such great peril.
"We do not know," he said.
She nodded, thinking: He's an honorable man. He wants a sign from me, but
he'll not tip fate by telling me the sign.
Jessica turned her head, stared down into the basin at the golden shadows,
the purple shadows, the vibrations of dust-mote air across the lip of their
cave. Her mind was filled suddenly with feline prudence. She knew the cant of
the Missionaria Protectiva, knew how to adapt the techniques of legend and fear
and hope to her emergency needs, but she sensed wild changes here . . . as
though someone had been in among these Fremen and capitalized on the Missionaria
Protectiva's imprint.
Stilgar cleared his throat.
She sensed his impatience, knew that the day moved ahead and men waited to
seal off this opening. This was a time for boldness on her part, and she
realized what she needed: some dar al-hikman, some school of translation that
would give her . . .
"Adab," she whispered.

Her mind felt as though it had rolled over within her. She recognized the
sensation with a quickening of pulse. Nothing in all the Bene Gesserit training
carried such a signal of recognition. It could be only the adab, the demanding
memory that comes upon you of itself. She gave herself up to it, allowing the
words to flow from her.
"Ibn qirtaiba," she said, "as far as the spot where the dust ends." She
stretched out an arm from her robe, seeing Stilgar's eyes go wide. She heard a
rustling of many robes in the background. "I see a . . . Fremen with the book of
examples," she intoned. "He reads to al-Lat, the sun whom he defied and
subjugated. He reads to the Sadus of the Trial and this is what he reads;
"Mine enemies are like green blades eaten down
That did stand in the path of the tempest.
Hast thou not seen what our Lord did?
He sent the pestilence among them
That did lay schemes against us.
They are like birds scattered by the huntsman.
Their schemes are like pellets of poison
That every mouth rejects."
A trembling passed through her. She dropped her arm.
Back to her from the inner cave's shadows came a whispered response of many
voices: "Their works have been overturned."
"The fire of God mount over thy heart," she said. And she thought: Now, it
goes in the proper channel.
"The fire of God set alight," came the response.
She nodded. "Thine enemies shall fall," she said.
"Bi-la kaifa," they answered.
In the sudden hush, Stilgar bowed to her. "Sayyadina," he said. "If the
Shai-hulud grant, then you may yet pass within to become a Reverend Mother."
Pass within, she thought. An odd way of putting it. But the rest of it
fitted into the cant well enough. And she felt a cynical bitterness at what she
had done. Our Missionaria Protectiva seldom fails. A place was prepared for us
in this wilderness. The prayer of the salat has carved out our hiding place. Now
. . . I must play the part of Auliya, the Friend of God . . . Sayyadina to rogue
peoples who've been so heavily imprinted with our Bene Gesserit soothsay they
even call their chief priestesses Reverend Mothers.
Paul stood beside Chani in the shadows of the inner cave. He could still
taste the morsel she had fed him--bird flesh and grain bound with spice honey
and encased in a leaf. In tasting it he had realized he never before had eaten
such a concentration of spice essence and there had been a moment of fear. He
knew what this essence could do to him--the spice change that pushed his mind
into prescient awareness.
"Bi-la kaifa," Chani whispered.
He looked at her, seeing the awe with which the Fremen appeared to accept
his mother's words. Only the man called Jamis seemed to stand aloof from the
ceremony, holding himself apart with arms folded across his breast.
"Duy yakha bin mange," Chani whispered. "Duy punra bin mange. I have two
eyes. I have two feet."
And she stared at Paul with a look of wonder.
Paul took a deep breath, trying to still the tempest within him. His
mother's words had locked onto the working of the spice essence, and he had felt
her voice rise and fall within him like the shadows of an open fire. Through it
all, he had sensed the edge of cynicism in her--he knew her so well!--but
nothing could stop this thing that had begun with a morsel of food.
Terrible purpose!

He sensed it, the race consciousness that he could not escape. There was the
sharpened clarity, the inflow of data, the cold precision of his awareness. He
sank to the floor, sitting with his back against rock, giving himself up to it.
Awareness flowed into that timeless stratum where he could view time, sensing
the available paths, the winds of the future . . . the winds of the past: the
one-eyed vision of the past, the one-eyed vision of the present and the one-eyed
vision of the future--all combined in a trinocular vision that permitted him to
see time-become-space.
There was danger, he felt, of overrunning himself, and he had to hold onto
his awareness of the present, sensing the blurred deflection of experience, the
flowing moment, the continual solidification of that-which-is into the
perpetual-was.
In grasping the present, he felt for the first time the massive steadiness
of time's movement everywhere complicated by shifting currents, waves, surges,
and countersurges, like surf against rocky cliffs. It gave him a new
understanding of his prescience, and he saw the source of blind time, the source
of error in it, with an immediate sensation of fear.
The prescience, he realized, was an illumination that incorporated the
limits of what it revealed--at once a source of accuracy and meaningful error. A
kind of Heisenberg indeterminacy intervened: the expenditure of energy that
revealed what he saw, changed what he saw.
And what he saw was a time nexus within this cave, a boiling of
possibilities focused here, wherein the most minute action--the wink of an eye,
a careless word, a misplaced grain of sand--moved a gigantic lever across the
known universe. He saw violence with the outcome subject to so many variables
that his slightest movement created vast shiftings in the pattern.
The vision made him want to freeze into immobility, but this, too, was
action with its consequences.
The countless consequences--lines fanned out from this cave, and along most
of these consequence-lines he saw his own dead body with blood flowing from a
gaping knife wound.
= = = = = =
My father, the Padishah Emperor, was 72 yet looked no more than 35 the year he
encompassed the death of Duke Leto and gave Arrakis back to the Harkonnens. He
seldom appeared in public wearing other than a Sardaukar uniform and a Burseg's
black helmet with the imperial lion in gold upon its crest. The uniform was an
open reminder of where his power lay. He was not always that blatant, though.
When he wanted, he could radiate charm and sincerity, but I often wonder in
these later days if anything about him was as it seemed. I think now he was a
man fighting constantly to escape the bars of an invisible cage. You must
remember that he was an emperor, father-head of a dynasty that reached back into
the dimmest history. But we denied him a legal son. Was this not the most
terrible defeat a ruler ever suffered? My mother obeyed her Sister Superiors
where the Lady Jessica disobeyed. Which of them was the stronger? History
already has answered.
-"In My Father's House" by the Princess Irulan
Jessica awakened in cave darkness, sensing the stir of Fremen around her,
smelling the acrid stillsuit odor. Her inner timesense told her it would soon be
night outside, but the cave remained in blackness, shielded from the desert by
the plastic hoods that trapped their body moisture within this space.
She realized that she had permitted herself the utterly relaxing sleep of
great fatigue, and this suggested something of her own unconscious assessment on
personal security within Stilgar's troop. She turned in the hammock that had
been fashioned of her robe, slipped her feet to the rock floor and into her
desert boots.
I must remember to fasten the boots slip-fashion to help my stillsuit's
pumping action, she thought. There are so many things to remember.
She could still taste their morning meal--the morsel of bird flesh and grain
bound within a leaf with spice honey--and it came to her that the use of time
was turned around here: night was the day of activity and day was the time of
rest.
Night conceals; night is safest.
She unhooked her robe from its hammock pegs in a rock alcove, fumbled with
the fabric in the dark until she found the top, slipped into it.
How to get a message out to the Bene Gesserit? she wondered. They would have
to be told of the two strays in Arrakeen sanctuary.
Glowglobes came alight farther into the cave. She saw people moving there,
Paul among them already dressed and with his hood thrown back to reveal the
aquiline Atreides profile.
He had acted so strangely before they retired, she thought. Withdrawn. He
was like one come back from the dead, not yet fully aware of his return, his
eyes half shut and glassy with the inward stare. It made her think of his
warning about the spice-impregnated diet: addictive.
Are there side effects? she wondered. He said it had something to do with
his prescient faculty, but he has been strangely silent about what he sees.
Stilgar came from shadows to her right, crossed to the group beneath the
glowglobes. She marked how he fingered his beard and the watchful, cat-stalking
look of him.
Abrupt fear shot through Jessica as her senses awakened to the tensions
visible in the people gathered around Paul--the stiff movements, the ritual
positions.
"They have my countenance!" Stilgar rumbled.
Jessica recognized the man Stilgar confronted--Jamis! She saw then the rage
in Jamis--the tight set of his shoulders.
Jamis, the man Paul bested! she thought.
"You know the rule, Stilgar," Jamis said.
"Who knows it better?" Stilgar asked, and she heard the tone of placation in
his voice, the attempt to smooth something over.
"I choose the combat," Jamis growled.
Jessica sped across the cave, grasped Stilgar's arm. "What is this?" she
asked.
"It is the amtal rule," Stilgar said. "Jamis is demanding the right to test
your part in the legend."
"She must be championed," Jamis said. "If her champion wins, that's the
truth in it. But it's said . . . " He glanced across the press of people. " . .
. that she'd need no champion from the Fremen--which can mean only that she
brings her own champion."
He's talking of single combat with Paul! Jessica thought.
She released Stilgar's arm, took a half-step forward. "I'm always my own
champion," she said. "The meaning's simple enough for . . . "
"You'll not tell us our ways!" Jamis snapped. "Not without more proof than
I've seen. Stilgar could've told you what to say last morning. He could've
filled your mind full of the coddle and you could've bird-talked it to us,
hoping to make a false way among us."
I can take him, Jessica thought, but that might conflict with the way they
interpret the legend. And again she wondered at the way the Missionaria
Protectiva's work had been twisted on this planet.
Stilgar looked at Jessica, spoke in a low voice but one designed to carry to
the crowd's fringe. "Jamis is one to hold a grudge, Sayyadina. Your son bested
him and--"
"It was an accident!" Jamis roared. "There was witch-force at Tuono Basin
and I'll prove it now!"
" . . . and I've bested him myself," Stilgar continued. "He seeks by this
tahaddi challenge to get back at me as well. There's too much of violence in
Jamis for him ever to make a good leader--too much ghafla, the distraction. He
gives his mouth to the rules and his heart to the sarfa, the turning away. No,
he could never make a good leader. I've preserved him this long because he's
useful in a fight as such, but when he gets this carving anger on him he's
dangerous to his own society."
"Stilgar-r-r-r!" Jamis rumbled.
And Jessica saw what Stilgar was doing, trying to enrage Jamis, to take the
challenge away from Paul.
Stilgar faced Jamis, and again Jessica heard the soothing in the rumbling
voice. "Jamis, he's but a boy. He's--"
"You named him a man," Jamis said. "His mother says he's been through the
gom jabbar. He's full-fleshed and with a surfeit of water. The ones who carried
their pack say there's literjons of water in it. Literjons! And us sipping our
catch-pockets the instant they show dewsparkle."
Stilgar glanced at Jessica. "Is this true? Is there water in your pack?"
"Yes."
"Literjons of it?"
"Two literjons."
"What was intended with this wealth?"
Wealth? she thought. She shook her head, feeling the coldness in his voice.
"Where I was born, water fell from the sky and ran over the land in wide
rivers," she said. "There were oceans of it so broad you could not see the other
shore. I've not been trained to your water discipline. I never before had to
think of it this way."
A sighing gasp arose from the people around them: "Water fell from the sky .
. . it ran over the land."
"Did you know there're those among us who've lost from their catch-pockets
by accident and will be in sore trouble before we reach Tabr this night?"
"How could I know?" Jessica shook her head. "If they're in need, give them
water from our pack."
"Is that what you intended with this wealth?"
"I intended it to save life," she said.
"Then we accept your blessing, Sayyadina."
"You'll not buy us off with water," Jamis growled. "Nor will you anger me
against yourself, Stilgar. I see you trying to make me call you out before I've
proved my words,"
Stilgar faced Jamis. "Are you determined to press this fight against a
child, Jamis?" His voice was low, venomous.
"She must be championed."
"Even though she has my countenance?"
"I invoke the amtal rule," Jamis said. "It's my right."
Stilgar nodded. "Then, if the boy does not carve you down, you'll answer to
my knife afterward. And this time I'll not hold back the blade as I've done
before."
"You cannot do this thing," Jessica said. "Paul's just--"
"You must not interfere, Sayyadina," Stilgar said. "Oh, I know you can take
me and, therefore, can take anyone among us, but you cannot best us all united.
This must be; it is the amtal rule."
Jessica fell silent, staring at him in the green light of the glowglobes,
seeing the demoniacal stiffness that had taken over his expression. She shifted
her attention to Jamis, saw the brooding look to his brows and thought: I
should've seen that before. He broods. He's the silent kind, one who works
himself up inside. I should've been prepared.

"If you harm my son," she said, "You'll have me to meet. I call you out now.
I'll carve you into a joint of--"
"Mother." Paul stepped forward, touched her sleeve. "Perhaps if I explain to
Jamis how--"
"Explain!" Jamis sneered.
Paul fell silent, staring at the man. He felt no fear of him. Jamis appeared
clumsy in his movements and he had fallen so easily in their night encounter on
the sand. But Paul still felt the nexus-boiling of this cave, still remembered
the prescient visions of himself dead under a knife. There had been so few
avenues of escape for him in that vision . . .
Stilgar said: "Sayyadina, you must step back now where--"
"Stop calling her Sayyadina!" Jamis said. "That's yet to be proved. So she
knows the prayer! What's that? Every child among us knows it."
He has talked enough, Jessica thought. I've the key to him. I could
immobilize him with a word. She hesitated. But I cannot stop them all.
"You will answer to me then," Jessica said, and she pitched her voice in a
twisting tone with a little whine in it and a catch at the end.
Jamis stared at her, fright visible on his face.
"I'll teach you agony," she said in the same tone. "Remember that as you
fight. You'll have agony such as will make the gom jabbar a happy memory by
comparison. You will writhe with your entire--"
"She tries a spell on me!" Jamis gasped. He put his clenched right fist
beside his ear. "I invoke the silence on her!"
"So be it then," Stilgar said. He cast a warning glance at Jessica. "If you
speak again, Sayyadina, we'll know it's your witchcraft and you'll be forfeit."
He nodded for her to step back.
Jessica felt hands pulling her, helping her back, and she sensed they were
not unkindly. She saw Paul being separated from the throng, the elfin-faced
Chani whispering in his ear as she nodded toward Jamis.
A ring formed within the troop. More glowglobes were brought and all of them
tuned to the yellow band.
Jamis stepped into the ring, slipped out of his robe and tossed it to
someone in the crowd. He stood there in a cloudy gray slickness of stillsuit
that was patched and marked by tucks and gathers. For a moment, he bent with his
mouth to his shoulder, drinking from a catchpocket tube. Presently he
straightened, peeled off and detached the suit, handed it carefully into the
crowd. He stood waiting, clad in loincloth and some tight fabric over his feet,
a crysknife in his right hand.
Jessica saw the girl-child Chani helping Paul, saw her press a crysknife
handle into his palm, saw him heft it, testing the weight and balance. And it
came to Jessica that Paul had been trained in prana and bindu, the nerve and the
fiber--that he had been taught fighting in a deadly school, his teachers men
like Duncan Idaho and Gurney Halleck, men who were legends in their own
lifetimes. The boy knew the devious ways of the Bene Gesserit and he looked
supple and confident.
But he's only fifteen, she thought. And he has no shield. I must stop this.
Somehow, there must be a way to . . . She looked up, saw Stilgar watching her.
"You cannot stop it," he said. "You must not speak."
She put a hand over her mouth, thinking: I've planted fear in Jamis' mind.
It'll slow him some . . . perhaps. If I could only pray--truly pray.
Paul stood alone now just into the ring, clad in the fighting trunks he'd
worn under his stillsuit. He held a crysknife in his right hand; his feet were
bare against the sand-gritted rock. Idaho had warned him time and again: "When
in doubt of your surface, bare feet are best." And there were Chani's words of
instruction still in the front of his consciousness: "Jamis turns to the right
with his knife after a parry. It's a habit in him we've all seen. And he'll aim
for the eyes to catch a blink in which to slash you. And he can fight either
hand; took out for a knife shift."
But strongest in Paul so that he felt it with his entire body was training
and the instinctual reaction mechanism that had been hammered into him day after
day, hour after hour on the practice floor.
Gurney Halleck's words were there to remember: "The good knife fighter
thinks on point and blade and shearing-guard simultaneously. The point can also
cut; the blade can also stab; the shearing-guard can also trap your opponent's
blade."
Paul glanced at the crysknife. There was no shearing-guard; only the slim
round ring of the handle with its raised lips to protect the hand. And even so,
he realized that he did not know the breaking tension of this blade, did not
even know if it could be broken.
Jamis began sidling to the right along the edge of the ring opposite Paul.
Paul crouched, realizing then that he had no shield, but was trained to
fighting with its subtle field around him, trained to react on defense with
utmost speed while his attack would be timed to the controlled slowness
necessary for penetrating the enemy's shield. In spite of constant warning from
his trainers not to depend on the shield's mindless blunting of attack speed, he
knew that shield-awareness was part of him.
Jamis called out in ritual challenge: "May thy knife chip and shatter!"
This knife will break then, Paul thought.
He cautioned himself that Jamis also was without shield, but the man wasn't
trained to its use, had no shield-fighter inhibitions.
Paul stared across the ring at Jamis. The man's body looked like knotted
whipcord on a dried skeleton. His crysknife shone milky yellow in the light of
the glowglobes.
Fear coursed through Paul. He felt suddenly alone and naked standing in dull
yellow light within this ring of people. Prescience had fed his knowledge with
countless experiences, hinted at the strongest currents of the future and the
strings of decision that guided them, but this was the real-now. This was death
hanging on an infinite number of miniscule mischances.
Anything could tip the future here, he realized. Someone coughing in the
troop of watchers, a distraction. A variation in a glowglobe's brilliance, a
deceptive shadow.
I'm afraid, Paul told himself.
And he circled warily opposite Jamis, repeating silently to himself the Bene
Gesserit litany against fear. "Fear is the mind-killer . . . " It was a cool
bath washing over him. He felt muscles untie themselves, become poised and
ready.
"I'll sheath my knife in your blood," Jamis snarled. And in the middle of
the last word he pounced.
Jessica saw the motion, stifled an outcry.
Where the man struck there was only empty air and Paul stood now behind
Jamis with a clear shot at the exposed back.
Now, Paul! Now! Jessica screamed it in her mind.
Paul's motion was slowly timed, beautifully fluid, but so slow it gave Jamis
the margin to twist away, backing and turning to the right.
Paul withdrew, crouching low. "First, you must find my blood," he said.
Jessica recognized the shield-fighter timing in her son, and it came over
her what a two-edged thing that was. The boy's reactions were those of youth and
trained to a peak these people had never seen. But the attack was trained, too,
and conditioned by the necessities of penetrating a shield barrier. A shield
would repel too fast a blow, admit only the slowly deceptive counter. It needed
control and trickery to get through a shield.
Does Paul see it? she asked herself. He must!

Again Jamis attacked, ink-dark eyes glaring, his body a yellow blur under
the glowglobes.
And again Paul slipped away to return too slowly on the attack.
And again.
And again.
Each time, Paul's counterblow came an instant late.
And Jessica saw a thing she hoped Jamis did not see. Paul's defensive
reactions were blindingly fast, but they moved each time at the precisely
correct angle they would take if a shield were helping deflect part of Jamis'
blow.
"Is your son playing with that poor fool?" Stilgar asked. He waved her to
silence before she could respond. "Sorry; you must remain silent."
Now the two figures on the rock floor circled each other; Jamis with knife
hand held far forward and tipped up slightly; Paul crouched with knife held low.
Again, Jamis pounced, and this time he twisted to the right where Paul had
been dodging.
Instead of faking back and out, Paul met the man's knife hand on the point
of his own blade. Then the boy was gone, twisting away to the left and thankful
for Chani's warning.
Jamis backed into the center of the circle, rubbing his knife hand. Blood
dripped from the injury for a moment, stopped. His eyes were wide and staring-two blue-black holes--studying Paul with a new wariness in the dull light of the
glowglobes.
"Ah, that one hurt," Stilgar murmured.
Paul crouched at the ready and, as he had been trained to do after first
blood, called out: "Do you yield?"
"Hah!" Jamis cried.
An angry murmur arose from the troop.
"Hold!" Stilgar called out. "The lad doesn't know our rule." Then, to Paul:
"There can be no yielding in the tahaddi-challenge. Death is the test of it."
Jessica saw Paul swallow hard. And she thought: He's never killed a man like
this . . . in the hot blood of a knife fight. Can he do it?
Paul circled slowly right, forced by Jamis' movement. The prescient
knowledge of the time-boiling variables in this cave came back to plague him
now. His new understanding told him there were too many swiftly compressed
decisions in this fight for any clear channel ahead to show itself.
Variable piled on variable--that was why this cave lay as a blurred nexus in
his path. It was like a gigantic rock in the flood, creating maelstroms in the
current around it.
"Have an end to it, lad," Stilgar muttered. "Don't play with him."
Paul crept farther into the ring, relying on his own edge in speed.
Jamis backed now that the realization swept over him--that this was no soft
offworlder in the tahaddi ring, easy prey for a Fremen crysknife.
Jessica saw the shadow of desperation in the man's face. Now is when he's
most dangerous, she thought. Now he's desperate and can do anything. He sees
that this is not like a child of his own people, but a fighting machine born and
trained to it from infancy. Now the fear I planted in him has come to bloom.
And she found in herself a sense of pity for Jamis--an emotion tempered by
awareness of the immediate peril to her son.
Jamis could do anything . . . any unpredictable thing, she told herself. She
wondered then if Paul had glimpsed this future, if he were reliving this
experience. But she saw the way her son moved, the beads of perspiration on his
face and shoulders, the careful wariness visible in the flow of muscles. And for
the first time she sensed, without understanding it, the uncertainty factor in
Paul's gift.
Paul pressed the fight now, circling but not attacking. He had seen the fear
in his opponent. Memory of Duncan Idaho's voice flowed through Paul's awareness:
"When your opponent fears you, then's the moment when you give the fear its own
rein, give it the time to work on him. Let it become terror. The terrified man
fights himself. Eventually, he attacks in desperation. That is the most
dangerous moment, but the terrified man can be trusted usually to make a fatal
mistake. You are being trained here to detect these mistakes and use them. "
The crowd in the cavern began to mutter.
They think Paul's toying with Jamis, Jessica thought. They think Paul's
being needlessly cruel.
But she sensed also the undercurrent of crowd excitement, their enjoyment of
the spectacle. And she could see the pressure building up in Jamis. The moment
when it became too much for him to contain was as apparent to her as it was to
Jamis . . . or to Paul.
Jamis leaped high, feinting and striking down with his right hand, but the
hand was empty. The crysknife had been shifted to his left hand.
Jessica gasped.
But Paul had been warned by Chani: "Jamis fights with either hand." And the
depth of his training had taken in that trick en passant. "Keep the mind on the
knife and not on the hand that holds it, " Gurney Halleck had told him time and
again. "The knife is more dangerous than the hand and the knife can be in either
hand."
And Paul had seen Jamis' mistake: bad footwork so that it took the man a
heartbeat longer to recover from his leap, which had been intended to confuse
Paul and hide the knife shift.
Except for the low yellow light of the glowglobes and the inky eyes of the
staring troop, it was similar to a session on the practice floor. Shields didn't
count where the body's own movement could be used against it. Paul shifted his
own knife in a blurred motion, slipped sideways and thrust upward where Jamis'
chest was descending--then away to watch the man crumble.
Jamis fell like a limp rag, face down, gasped once and turned his face
toward Paul, then lay still on the rock floor. His dead eyes stared out like
beads of dark glass.
"Killing with the point lacks artistry," Idaho had once told Paul, "but
don't let that hold your hand when the opening presents itself."
The troop rushed forward, filling the ring, pushing Paul aside. They hid
Jamis in a frenzy of huddling activity. Presently a group of them hurried back
into the depths of the cavern carrying a burden wrapped in a robe.
And there was no body on the rock floor.
Jessica pressed through toward her son. She felt that she swam in a sea of
robed and stinking backs, a throng strangely silent.
Now is the terrible moment, she thought. He has killed a man in clear
superiority of mind and muscle. He must not grow to enjoy such a victory.
She forced herself through the last of the troop and into a small open space
where two bearded Fremen were helping Paul into his stillsuit.
Jessica stared at her son. Paul's eyes were bright. He breathed heavily,
permitting the ministrations to his body rather than helping them.
"Him against Jamis and not a mark on him," one of the men muttered.
Chani stood at one side, her eyes focused on Paul. Jessica saw the girl's
excitement, the admiration in the elfin face.
It must be done now and swiftly, Jessica thought.
She compressed ultimate scorn into her voice and manner, said: "Well-l-l,
now--how does it feel to be a killer?"
Paul stiffened as though he had been struck. He met his mother's cold glare
and his face darkened with a rush of blood. Involuntarily he glanced toward the
place on the cavern floor where Jamis had lain.
Stilgar pressed through to Jessica's side, returning from the cave depths
where the body of Jamis had been taken. He spoke to Paul in a bitter, controlled
tone: "When the time comes for you to call me out and try for my burda, do not
think you will play with me the way you played with Jamis."
Jessica sensed the way her own words and Stilgar's sank into Paul, doing
their harsh work on the boy. The mistake these people made--it served a purpose
now. She searched the faces around them as Paul was doing, seeing what he saw.
Admiration, yes, and fear . . . and in some--loathing. She looked at Stilgar,
saw his fatalism, knew how the fight had seemed to him.
Paul looked at his mother. "You know what it was," he said.
She heard the return to sanity, the remorse in his voice. Jessica swept her
glance across the troop, said: "Paul has never before killed a man with a naked
blade."
Stilgar faced her, disbelief in his face.
"I wasn't playing with him," Paul said. He pressed in front of his mother,
straightening his robe, glanced at the dark place of Jamis' blood on the cavern
floor. "I did not want to kill him."
Jessica saw belief come slowly to Stilgar, saw the relief in him as he
tugged at his beard with a deeply veined hand. She heard muttering awareness
spread through the troop.
"That's why y' asked him to yield," Stilgar said. "I see. Our ways are
different, but you'll see the sense in them. I thought we'd admitted a scorpion
into our midst." He hesitated, then: "And I shall not call you lad the more."
A voice from the troop called out: "Needs a naming, Stil."
Stilgar nodded, tugging at his beard. "I see strength in you . . . like the
strength beneath a pillar." Again he paused, then: "You shall be known among us
as Usul, the base of the pillar. This is your secret name, your troop name. We
of Sietch Tabr may use it, but none other may so presume . . . Usul."
Murmuring went through the troop: "Good choice, that . . . strong . . .
bring us luck." And Jessica sensed the acceptance, knowing she was included in
it with her champion. She was indeed Sayyadina.
"Now, what name of manhood do you choose for us to call you openly?" Stilgar
asked.
Paul glanced at his mother, back to Stilgar. Bits and pieces of this moment
registered on his prescient memory, but he felt the differences as though they
were physical, a pressure forcing him through the narrow door of the present.
"How do you call among you the little mouse, the mouse that jumps?" Paul
asked, remembering the pop-hop of motion at Tuono Basin. He illustrated with one
hand.
A chuckle sounded through the troop.
"We call that one Muad'Dib," Stilgar said.
Jessica gasped. It was the name Paul had told her, saying that the Fremen
would accept them and call him thus. She felt a sudden fear of her son and for
him.
Paul swallowed. He felt that he played a part already played over countless
times in his mind . . . yet . . . there were differences. He could see himself
perched on a dizzying summit, having experienced much and possessed of a
profound store of knowledge, but all around him was abyss.
And again he remembered the vision of fanatic legions following the green
and black banner of the Atreides, pillaging and burning across the universe in
the name of their prophet Muad'Dib.
That must not happen, he told himself.
"Is that the name you wish, Muad'Dib?" Stilgar asked.
"I am an Atreides," Paul whispered, and then louder: "It's not right that I
give up entirely the name my father gave me. Could I be known among you as PaulMuad'Dib?"
"You are Paul-Muad'Dib," Stilgar said.
And Paul thought: That was in no vision of mine. I did a different thing.
But he felt that the abyss remained all around him.

Again a murmuring response went through the troop as man turned to man:
"Wisdom with strength . . . Couldn't ask more . . . It's the legend for sure . .
. Lisan al-Gaib . . . Lisan al-Gaib . . . "
"I will tell you a thing about your new name," Stilgar said. "The choice
pleases us. Muad'Dib is wise in the ways of the desert. Muad'Dib creates his own
water. Muad'Dib hides from the sun and travels in the cool night. Muad'Dib is
fruitful and multiplies over the land. Muad'Dib we call 'instructor-of-boys.'
That is a powerful base on which to build your life, Paul-Muad'Dib, who is Usul
among us. We welcome you."
Stilgar touched Paul's forehead with one palm, withdrew his hand, embraced
Paul and murmured, "Usul."
As Stilgar released him, another member of the troop embraced Paul,
repeating his new troop name. And Paul was passed from embrace to embrace
through the troop, hearing the voices, the shadings of tone; "Usul . . . Usul .
. . Usul." Already, he could place some of them by name. And there was Chani who
pressed her cheek against his as she held him and said his name.
Presently Paul stood again before Stilgar, who said: "Now, you are of the
Ichwan Bedwine, our brother." His face hardened, and he spoke with command in
his voice. "And now, Paul-Muad'Dib, tighten up that stillsuit." He glanced at
Chani. "Chani! Paul-Muad'Dib's nose plugs are as poor a fit I've ever seen! I
thought I ordered you to see after him! "
"I hadn't the makings, Stil," she said. "There's Jamis' of course, but--"
"Enough of that!"
"Then I'll share one of mine," she said. "I can make do with one until--"
"You will not," Stilgar said. "I know there are spares among us. Where are
the spares? Are we a troop together or a band of savages?"
Hands reached out from the troop offering hard, fibrous objects. Stilgar
selected four, handed them to Chani. "Fit these to Usul and the Sayyadina."
A voice lifted from the back of the troop: "What of the water, Stil? What of
the literjons in their pack?"
"I know your need, Farok," Stilgar said. He glanced at Jessica. She nodded.
"Broach one for those that need it," Stilgar said. "Watermaster . . . where
is a watermaster? Ah, Shimoom, care for the measuring of what is needed. The
necessity and no more. This water is the dower property of the Sayyadina and
will be repaid in the sietch at field rates less pack fees."
"What is the repayment at field rates?" Jessica asked.
"Ten for one," Stilgar said.
"But--"
"It's a wise rule as you'll come to see," Stilgar said.
A rustling of robes marked movement at the back of the troop as men turned
to get the water.
Stilgar held up a hand, and there was silence. "As to Jamis," he said, "I
order the full ceremony. Jamis was our companion and brother of the Ichwan
Bedwine. There shall be no turning away without the respect due one who proved
our fortune by his tahaddi-challenge. I invoke the rite . . . at sunset when the
dark shall cover him."
Paul, hearing these words, realized that he had plunged once more into the
abyss . . . blind time. There was no past occupying the future in his mind . . .
except . . . except . . . he could still sense the green and black Atreides
banner waving . . . somewhere ahead . . . still see the jihad's bloody swords
and fanatic legions.
It will not be, he told himself. I cannot let it be.

In the stillness of the cavern, Jessica heard the scrape of sand on rock as
people moved, the distant bird calls that Stilgar had said were the signals of
his watchmen.
The great plastic hood-seals had been removed from the cave's opening. She
could see the march of evening shadows across the lip of rock in front of her
and the open basin beyond. She sensed the daylight leaving them, sensed it in
the dry heat as well as the shadows. She knew her trained awareness soon would
give her what these Fremen obviously had--the ability to sense even the
slightest change in the air's moisture.
How they had scurried to tighten their stillsuits when the cave was opened!
Deep within the cave, someone began chanting:
"Ima trava okolo!
I korenja okolo!"
Jessica translated silently: These are ashes! And these are roots! "
The funeral ceremony for Jamis was beginning.
She looked out at the Arrakeen sunset, at the banked decks of color in the
sky. Night was beginning to utter its shadows along the distant rocks and the
dunes.
Yet the heat persisted.
Heat forced her thoughts onto water and the observed fact that this whole
people could be trained to be thirsty only at given times.
Thirst.
She could remember moonlit waves on Caladan throwing white robes over rocks
. . . and the wind heavy with dampness. Now the breeze that fingered her robes
seared the patches of exposed skin at cheeks and forehead. The new nose plugs
irritated her, and she found herself overly conscious of the tube that trailed
down across her face into the suit, recovering her breath's moisture.
The suit itself was a sweatbox.
"Your suit will be more comfortable when you've adjusted to a lower wafer
content in your body, " Stilgar had said.
She knew he was right, but the knowledge made this moment no more
comfortable. The unconscious preoccupation with water here weighed on her mind.
No, she corrected herself: it was preoccupation with moisture.
And that was a more subtle and profound matter.
She heard approaching footsteps, turned to see Paul come out of the cave's
depths trailed by the elfin-faced Chani.
There's another thing, Jessica thought. Paul must be cautioned about their
women. One of these desert women would not do as wife to a Duke. As concubine,
yes, but not as wife.
Then she wondered at herself, thinking: Have I been infected with his
schemes? And she saw how well she had been conditioned. I can think of the
marital needs of royalty without once weighing my own concubinage. Yet . . . I
was more than concubine.
"Mother."
Paul stopped in front of her. Chani stood at his elbow.
"Mother, do you know what they're doing back there?"
Jessica looked at the dark patch of his eyes staring out from the hood. "I
think so."
"Chani showed me . . . because I'm supposed to see it and give my . . .
permission for the weighing of the water."
Jessica looked at Chani.
"They're recovering Jamis' water," Chani said, and her thin voice came out
nasal past the nose plugs. "It's the rule. The flesh belongs to the person, but
his water belongs to the tribe . . . except in the combat."
"They say the water's mine," Paul said.
Jessica wondered why this should make her suddenly alert and cautious.
"Combat water belongs to the winner," Chani said. "It's because you have to
fight in the open without stillsuits. The winner has to get his water back that
he loses while fighting."
"I don't want his water," Paul muttered. He felt that he was a part of many
images moving simultaneously in a fragmenting way that was disconcerting to the
inner eye. He could not be certain what he would do, but of one thing he was
positive: he did not want the water distilled out of Jamis' flesh.
"It's . . . water," Chani said.
Jessica marveled at the way she said it. "Water." So much meaning in a
simple sound. A Bene Gesserit axiom came to Jessica's mind: "Survival is the
ability to swim in strange water." And Jessica thought: Paul and I, we must find
the currents and patterns in these strange waters . . . if we're to survive.
"You will accept the water," Jessica said.
She recognized the tone in her voice. She had used that same tone once with
Leto, telling her lost Duke that he would accept a large sum offered for his
support in a questionable venture--because money maintained power for the
Atreides.
On Arrakis, water was money. She saw that clearly.
Paul remained silent, knowing then that he would do as she ordered--not
because she ordered it, but because her tone of voice had forced him to reevaluate. To refuse the water would be to break with accepted Fremen practice.
Presently Paul recalled the words of 467 Kalima in Yueh's O.C. Bible. He
said: "From water does all life begin."
Jessica stared at him. Where did he learn that quotation? she asked herself.
He hasn't studied the mysteries.
"Thus it is spoken," Chani said. "Giudichar mantene: It is written in the
Shah-Nama that water was the first of all things created."
For no reason she could explain (and this bothered her more than the
sensation), Jessica suddenly shuddered. She turned away to hide her confusion
and was just in time to see the sunset. A violent calamity of color spilled over
the sky as the sun dipped beneath the horizon.
"It is time!"
The voice was Stilgar's ringing in the cavern. "Jamis' weapon has been
killed. Jamis has been called by Him, by Shai-hulud, who has ordained the phases
for the moons that daily wane and--in the end--appear as bent and withered
twigs." Stilgar's voice lowered. "Thus it is with Jamis."
Silence fell like a blanket on the cavern.
Jessica saw the gray-shadow movement of Stilgar like a ghost figure within
the dark inner reaches. She glanced back at the basin, sensing the coolness.
"The friends of Jamis will approach," Stilgar said.
Men moved behind Jessica, dropping a curtain across the opening. A single
glowglobe was lighted overhead far back in the cave. Its yellow glow picked out
an inflowing of human figures. Jessica heard the rustling of the robes.
Chani took a step away as though pulled by the light.
Jessica bent close to Paul's ear, speaking in the family code: "Follow their
lead; do as they do. It will be a simple ceremony to placate the shade of
Jamis."
It will be more than that, Paul thought. And he felt a wrenching sensation
within his awareness as though he were trying to grasp some thing in motion and
render it motionless.
Chani glided back to Jessica's side, took her hand. "Come, Sayyadina. We
must sit apart."
Paul watched them move off into the shadows, leaving him alone. He felt
abandoned.
The men who had fixed the curtain came up beside him.

"Come, Usul."
He allowed himself to be guided forward, to be pushed into a circle of
people being formed around Stilgar, who stood beneath the glowglobe and beside a
bundled, curving, and angular shape gathered beneath a robe on the rock floor.
The troop crouched down at a gesture from Stilgar, their robes hissing with
the movement. Paul settled with them, watching Stilgar, noting the way the
overhead globe made pits of his eyes and brightened the touch of green fabric at
his neck. Paul shifted his attention to the robe-covered mound at Stilgar's
feet, recognized the handle of a baliset protruding from the fabric.
"The spirit leaves the body's water when the first moon rises," Stilgar
intoned. "Thus it is spoken. When we see the first moon rise this night, whom
will it summon?"
"Jamis," the troop responded.
Stilgar turned full circle on one heel, passing his gaze across the ring of
faces. "I was a friend of Jamis," he said. "When the hawk plane stooped upon us
at Hole-in-the-Rock, it was Jamis pulled me to safety."
He bent over the pile beside him, lifted away the robe. "I take this robe as
a friend of Jamis--leader's right." He draped the robe over a shoulder,
straightening.
Now, Paul saw the contents of the mound exposed: the pale glistening gray of
a stillsuit, a battered literjon, a kerchief with a small book in its center,
the bladeless handle of a crysknife, an empty sheath, a folded pack, a
paracompass, a distrans, a thumper, a pile of fist-sized metallic hooks, an
assortment of what looked like small rocks within a fold of cloth, a clump of
bundled feathers . . . and the baliset exposed beside the folded pack.
So Jamis played the baliset, Paul thought. The instrument reminded him of
Gurney Halleck and all that was lost. Paul knew with his memory of the future in
the past that some chance-lines could produce a meeting with Halleck, but the
reunions were few and shadowed. They puzzled him. The uncertainty factor touched
him with wonder. Does it mean that something I will do . . . that I may do,
could destroy Gurney . . . or bring him back to life . . . or . . .
Paul swallowed, shook his head.
Again, Stilgar bent over the mound.
"For Jamis' woman and for the guards," he said. The small rocks and the book
were taken into the folds of his robe.
"Leader's right," the troop intoned.
"The marker for Jamis' coffee service," Stilgar said, and he lifted a flat
disc of green metal. "That it shall be given to Usul in suitable ceremony when
we return to the sietch."
"Leader's right," the troop intoned.
Lastly, he took the crysknife handle and stood with it.
"For the funeral plain," he said.
"For the funeral plain," the troop responded.
At her place in the circle across from Paul, Jessica nodded, recognizing the
ancient source of the rite, and she thought: The meeting between ignorance and
knowledge, between brutality and culture--it begins in the dignity with which we
treat our dead. She looked across at Paul, wondering: Will he see it? Will he
know what to do?
"We are friends of Jamis," Stilgar said. "We are not wailing for our dead
like a pack of garvarg."
A gray-bearded man to Paul's left stood up. "I was a friend of Jamis," he
said. He crossed to the mound, lifted the distrans. "When our water went below
minim at the siege at Two Birds, Jamis shared." The man returned to his place in
the circle.
Am I supposed to say I was a friend of Jamis? Paul wondered. Do they expect
me to take something from that pile? He saw faces turn toward him, turn away.
They do expect it!

Another man across from Paul arose, went to the pack and removed the
paracompass. "I was a friend of Jamis," he said. "When the patrol caught us at
Bight-of-the-Cliff and I was wounded, Jamis drew them off so the wounded could
be saved." He returned to his place in the circle.
Again, the faces turned toward Paul, and he saw the expectancy in them,
lowered his eyes. An elbow nudged him and a voice hissed: "Would you bring the
destruction on us?"
How can I say I was his friend? Paul wondered.
Another figure arose from the circle opposite Paul and, as the hooded face
came into the light, he recognized his mother. She removed a kerchief from the
mount. "I was a friend of Jamis," she said. "When the spirit of spirits within
him saw the needs of truth, that spirit withdrew and spared my son." She
returned to her place.
And Paul recalled the scorn in his mother's voice as she had confronted him
after the fight. "How does it f eel to be a killer?"
Again, he saw the faces turned toward him, felt the anger and fear in the
troop. A passage his mother had once filmbooked for him on "The Cult of the
Dead" flickered through Paul's mind. He knew what he had to do.
Slowly, Paul got to his feet.
A sigh passed around the circle.
Paul felt the diminishment of his self as he advanced into the center of the
circle. It was as though he lost a fragment of himself and sought it here. He
bent over the mound of belongings, lifted out the baliset. A string twanged
softly as it struck against something in the pile.
"I was a friend of Jamis," Paul whispered.
He felt tears burning his eyes, forced more volume into his voice. "Jamis
taught me . . . that . . . when you kill . . . you pay for it. I wish I'd known
Jamis better."
Blindly, he groped his way back to his place in the circle, sank to the rock
floor.
A voice hissed: "He sheds tears!"
It was taken up around the ring: "Usul gives moisture to the dead!"
He felt fingers touch his damp cheek, heard the awed whispers.
Jessica, hearing the voices, felt the depth of the experience, realized what
terrible inhibitions there must be against shedding tears. She focused on the
words: "He gives moisture to the dead." It was a gift to the shadow world-tears. They would be sacred beyond a doubt.
Nothing on this planet had so forcefully hammered into her the ultimate
value of water. Not the water-sellers, not the dried skins of the natives, not
stillsuits or the rules of water discipline. Here there was a substance more
precious than all others--it was life itself and entwined all around with
symbolism and ritual.
Water.
"I touched his cheek," someone whispered. "I felt the gift."
At first, the fingers touching his face frightened Paul. He clutched the
cold handle of the baliset, feeling the strings bite his palm. Then he saw the
faces beyond the groping hands--the eyes wide and wondering.
Presently, the hands withdrew. The funeral ceremony resumed. But now there
was a subtle space around Paul, a drawing back as the troop honored him by a
respectful isolation. The ceremony ended with a low chant:
"Full moon calls thee-Shai-hulud shall thou see;
Red the night, dusky sky,
Bloody death didst thou die.
We pray to a moon: she is round-Luck with us will then abound,
What we seek for shall be found
In the land of solid ground."
A bulging sack remained at Stilgar's feet. He crouched, placed his palms
against it. Someone came up beside him, crouched at his elbow, and Paul
recognized Chani's face in the hood shadow.
"Jamis carried thirty-three liters and seven and three-thirty-seconds
drachms of the tribe's water," Chani said. "I bless it now in the presence of a
Sayyadina. Ekkeri-akairi, this is the water, fillissin-follasy of Paul-Muad'Dib!
Kivi a-kavi, never the more, nakalas! Nakelas! to be measured and counted,
ukair-an! by the heartbeats jan-jan-jan of our friend . . . Jamis."
In an abrupt and profound silence, Chani turned, stared at Paul. Presently
she said: "Where I am flame be thou the coals. Where I am dew be thou the
water."
"Bi-lal kaifa," intoned the troop.
"To Paul-Muad'Dib goes this portion," Chani said. "May he guard it for the
tribe, preserving it against careless loss. May he be generous with it in time
of need. May he pass it on in his time for the good of the tribe."
"Bi-lal kaifa," intoned the troop.
I must accept that water, Paul thought. Slowly, he arose, made his way to
Chani's side. Stilgar stepped back to make room for him, took the baliset gently
from his hand.
"Kneel," Chani said.
Paul knelt.
She guided his hands to the waterbag, held them against the resilient
surface. "With this water the tribe entrusts thee," she said. "Jamis is gone
from it. Take it in peace." She stood, pulling Paul up with her.
Stilgar returned the baliset, extended a small pile of metal rings in one
palm. Paul looked at them, seeing the different sizes, the way the light of the
glowglobe reflected off them.
Chani took the largest ring, held it on a finger. "Thirty liters," she said.
One by one, she took the others, showing each to Paul, counting them. "Two
liters; one liter; seven watercounters of one drachm each; one watercounter of
three-thirty-seconds drachms. In all--thirty-three liters and seven and threethirty-seconds drachms."
She held them up on her finger for Paul to see.
"Do you accept them?" Stilgar asked.
Paul swallowed, nodded. "Yes."
"Later," Chani said, "I will show you how to tie them in a kerchief so they
won't rattle and give you away when you need silence." She extended her hand.
"Will you . . . hold them for me?" Paul asked.
Chani turned a startled glance on Stilgar.
He smiled, said, "Paul-Muad'Dib who is Usul does not yet know our ways,
Chani. Hold his watercounters without commitment until it's time to show him the
manner of carrying them."
She nodded, whipped a ribbon of cloth from beneath her robe, linked the
rings onto it with an intricate over and under weaving, hesitated, then stuffed
them into the sash beneath her robe.
I missed something there, Paul thought. He sensed the feeling of humor
around him, something bantering in it, and his mind linked up a prescient
memory: watercounters offered to a woman--courtship ritual.
"Watermasters," Stilgar said.
The troop arose in a hissing of robes. Two men stepped out, lifted the
waterbag. Stilgar took down the glowglobe, led the way with it into the depths
of the cave.

Paul was pressed in behind Chani, noted the buttery glow of light over rock
walls, the way the shadows danced, and he felt the troop's lift of spirits
contained in a hushed air of expectancy.
Jessica, pulled into the end of the troop by eager hands, hemmed around by
jostling bodies, suppressed a moment of panic. She had recognized fragments of
the ritual, identified the shards of Chakobsa and Bhotani-jib in the words, and
she knew the wild violence that could explode out of these seemingly simple
moments.
Jan-jan-jan, she thought. Go-go-go.
It was like a child's game that had lost all inhibition in adult hands.
Stilgar stopped at a yellow rock wall. He pressed an outcropping and the
wall swung silently away from him, opening along an irregular crack. He led the
way through past a dark honeycomb lattice that directed a cool wash of air
across Paul when he passed it.
Paul turned a questioning stare on Chani, tugged her arm. "That air felt
damp," he said.
"Sh-h-h-h," she whispered.
But a man behind them said: "Plenty of moisture in the trap tonight. Jamis'
way of telling us he's satisfied."
Jessica passed through the secret door, heard it close behind. She saw how
the Fremen slowed while passing the honeycomb lattice, felt the dampness of the
air as she came opposite it.
Windtrap! she thought. They've a concealed windtrap somewhere on the surface
to funnel air down here into cooler regions and precipitate the moisture from
it.
They passed through another rock door with latticework above it, and the
door closed behind them. The draft of air at their backs carried a sensation of
moisture clearly perceptible to both Jessica and Paul.
At the head of the troop, the glowglobe in Stilgar's hands dropped below the
level of the heads in front of Paul. Presently he felt steps beneath his feet,
curving down to the left. Light reflected back up across hooded heads and a
winding movement of people spiraling down the steps.
Jessica sensed mounting tension in the people around her, a pressure of
silence that rasped her nerves with its urgency.
The steps ended and the troop passed through another low door. The light of
the glowglobe was swallowed in a great open space with a high curved ceiling.
Paul felt Chani's hand on his arm, heard a faint dripping sound in the chill
air, felt an utter stillness come over the Fremen in the cathedral presence of
water.
I have seen this place in a dream, he thought.
The thought was both reassuring and frustrating. Somewhere ahead of him on
this path, the fanatic hordes cut their gory path across the universe in his
name. The green and black Atreides banner would become a symbol of terror. Wild
legions would charge into battle screaming their war cry: "Muad'Dib!"
It must not be, he thought. I cannot let it happen.
But he could feel the demanding race consciousness within him, his own
terrible purpose, and he knew that no small thing could deflect the juggernaut.
It was gathering weight and momentum. If he died this instant, the thing would
go on through his mother and his unborn sister. Nothing less than the deaths of
all the troop gathered here and now--himself and his mother included--could stop
the thing.
Paul stared around him, saw the troop spread out in a line. They pressed him
forward against a low barrier carved from native rock. Beyond the barrier in the
glow of Stilgar's globe, Paul saw an unruffled dark surface of water. It
stretched away into shadows--deep and black--the far wall only faintly visible,
perhaps a hundred meters away.

Jessica felt the dry pulling of skin on her cheeks and forehead relaxing in
the presence of moisture. The water pool was deep; she could sense its deepness,
and resisted a desire to dip her hands into it.
A splashing sounded on her left. She looked down the shadowy line of Fremen,
saw Stilgar with Paul standing beside him and the watermasters emptying their
load into the pool through a flowmeter. The meter was a round gray eye above the
pool's rim. She saw its glowing pointer move as the water flowed through it, saw
the pointer stop at thirty-three liters, seven and three-thirty-seconds drachms.
Superb accuracy in water measurement, Jessica thought. And she noted that
the walls of the meter trough held no trace of moisture after the water's
passage. The water flowed off those walls without binding tension. She saw a
profound clue to Fremen technology in the simple fact: they were perfectionists.
Jessica worked her way down the barrier to Stilgar's side. Way was made for
her with casual courtesy. She noted the withdrawn look in Paul's eyes, but the
mystery of this great pool of water dominated her thoughts.
Stilgar looked at her. "There were those among us in need of water," he
said, "yet they would come here and not touch this water. Do you know that?"
"I believe it," she said.
He looked at the pool. "We have more than thirty-eight million decaliters
here," he said. "Walled off from the little makers, hidden and preserved."
"A treasure trove," she said.
Stilgar lifted the globe to look into her eyes. "It is greater than
treasure. We have thousands of such caches. Only a few of us know them all." He
cocked his head to one side. The globe cast a yellow-shadowed glow across face
and beard. "Hear that?"
They listened.
The dripping of water precipitated from the windtrap filled the room with
its presence. Jessica saw that the entire troop was caught up in a rapture of
listening. Only Paul seemed to stand remote from it.
To Paul, the sound was like moments ticking away. He could feel time flowing
through him, the instants never to be recaptured. He sensed a need for decision,
but felt powerless to move.
"It has been calculated with precision," Stilgar whispered. "We know to
within a million decaliters how much we need. When we have it, we shall change
the face of Arrakis."
A hushed whisper of response lifted from the troop: "Bi-lal kaifa."
"We will trap the dunes beneath grass plantings," Stilgar said, his voice
growing stronger. "We will tie the water into the soil with trees and
undergrowth."
"Bi-lal kaifa," intoned the troop.
"Each year the polar ice retreats," Stilgar said.
"Bi-lal kaifa," they chanted.
"We shall make a homeworld of Arrakis--with melting lenses at the poles,
with lakes in the temperate zones, and only the deep desert for the maker and
his spice."
"Bi-lal kaifa."
"And no man ever again shall want for water. It shall be his for dipping
from well or pond or lake or canal. It shall run down through the qanats to feed
our plants. It shall be there for any man to take. It shall be his for holding
out his hand."
"Bi-lal kaifa."
Jessica felt the religious ritual in the words, noted her own instinctively
awed response. They're in league with the future, she thought. They have their
mountain to climb. This is the scientist's dream . . . and these simple people,
these peasants, are filled with it.
Her thoughts turned to Liet-Kynes, the Emperor's planetary ecologist, the
man who had gone native--and she wondered at him. This was a dream to capture
men's souls, and she could sense the hand of the ecologist in it. This was a
dream for which men would die willingly. It was another of the essential
ingredients that she felt her son needed; people with a goal. Such people would
be easy to imbue with fervor and fanaticism. They could be wielded like a sword
to win back Paul's place for him.
"We leave now," Stilgar said, "and wait for the first moon's rising. When
Jamis is safely on his way, we will go home."
Whispering their reluctance, the troop fell in behind him, turned back along
the water barrier and up the stairs.
And Paul, walking behind Chani, felt that a vital moment had passed him,
that he had missed an essential decision and was now caught up in his own myth.
He knew he had seen this place before, experienced it in a fragment of prescient
dream on faraway Caladan, but details of the place were being filled in now that
he had not seen. He felt a new sense of wonder at the limits of his gift. It was
as though he rode within the wave of time, sometimes in its trough, sometimes on
a crest--and all around him the other waves lifted and fell, revealing and then
hiding what they bore on their surface.
Through it all, the wild jihad still loomed ahead of him, the violence and
the slaughter. It was like a promontory above the surf.
The troop filed through the last door into the main cavern. The door was
sealed. Lights were extinguished, hoods removed from the cavern openings,
revealing the night and the stars that had come over the desert.
Jessica moved to the dry lip of the cavern's edge, looked up at the stars.
They were sharp and near. She felt the stirring of the troop around her, heard
the sound of a baliset being tuned somewhere behind her, and Paul's voice
humming the pitch. There was a melancholy in his tone that she did not like.
Chani's voice intruded from the deep cave darkness: "Tell me about the
waters of your birthworld, Paul Muad'Dib."
And Paul: "Another time, Chani. I promise."
Such sadness.
"It's a good baliset," Chani said.
"Very good," Paul said. "Do you think Jamis'll mind my using it?"
He speaks of the dead in the present tense, Jessica thought. The
implications disturbed her.
A man's voice intruded: "He liked music betimes, Jamis did."
"Then sing me one of your songs," Chani pleaded.
Such feminine allure in that girl-child's voice, Jessica thought. I must
caution Paul about their women . . . and soon.
"This was a song of a friend of mine," Paul said. "I expect he's dead now,
Gurney is. He called it his evensong."
The troop grew still, listening as Paul's voice lifted in a sweet boy tenor
with the baliset tinkling and strumming beneath it:
"This clear time of seeing embers-A gold-bright sun's lost in first dusk.
What frenzied senses, desp'rate musk
Are consort of rememb'ring."
Jessica felt the verbal music in her breast--pagan and charged with sounds
that made her suddenly and intensely aware of herself, feeling her own body and
its needs. She listened with a tense stillness.
"Night's pearl-censered requi-em . . .
"Tis for us!
What joys run, then-Bright in your eyes-What flower-spangled amores
Pull at our hearts . . .
What flower-spangled amores
Fill our desires."
And Jessica heard the after-stillness that hummed in the air with the last
note. Why does my son sing a love song to that girl-child? she asked herself.
She felt an abrupt fear. She could sense life flowing around her and she had no
grasp on its reins. Why did he choose that song? she wondered. The instincts are
true sometimes. Why did he do this?
Paul sat silently in the darkness, a single stark thought dominating his
awareness: My mother is my enemy. She does not know it, but she is. She is
bringing the jihad. She bore me; she trained me. She is my enemy.

-from "Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
On his seventeenth birthday, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen killed his one hundredth
slave-gladiator in the family games. Visiting observers from the Imperial Court-a Count and Lady Fenring--were on the Harkonnen homeworld of Giedi Prime for
the event, invited to sit that afternoon with the immediate family in the golden
box above the triangular arena.
In honor of the na-Baron's nativity and to remind all Harkonnens and
subjects that Feyd-Rautha was heir-designate, it was holiday on Giedi Prime. The
old Baron had decreed a meridian-to-meridian rest from labors, and effort had
been spent in the family city of Harko to create the illusion of gaiety: banners
flew from buildings, new paint had been splashed on the walls along Court Way.
But off the main way, Count Fenring and his lady noted the rubbish heaps,
the scabrous brown walls reflected in the dark puddles of the streets, and the
furtive scurrying of the people.
In the Baron's blue-walled keep, there was fearful perfection, but the Count
and his lady saw the price being paid--guards everywhere and weapons with that
special sheen that told a trained eye they were in regular use. There were
checkpoints for routine passage from area to area even within the keep. The
servants revealed their military training in the way they walked, in the set of
their shoulders . . . in the way their eyes watched and watched and watched.
"The pressure's on," the Count hummed to his lady in their secret language.
"The Baron is just beginning to see the price he really paid to rid himself of
the Duke Leto."
"Sometime I must recount for you the legend of the phoenix," she said.
They were in the reception hall of the keep waiting to go to the family
games. It was not a large hall--perhaps forty meters long and half that in
width--but false pillars along the sides had been shaped with an abrupt taper,
and the ceiling had a subtle arch, all giving the illusion of much greater
space.
"Ah-h-h, here comes the Baron," the Count said.
The Baron moved down the length of the hall with that peculiar waddlingglide imparted by the necessities of guiding suspensor-hung weight. His jowls
bobbed up and down; the suspensors jiggled and shifted beneath his orange robe.
Rings glittered on his hands and opafires shone where they had been woven into
the robe.
At the Baron's elbow walked Feyd-Rautha. His dark hair was dressed in close
ringlets that seemed incongruously gay above sullen eyes. He wore a tightfitting black tunic and snug trousers with a suggestion of bell at the bottom.
Soft-soled slippers covered his small feet.

Lady Fenring, noting the young man's poise and the sure flow of muscles
beneath the tunic thought: Here's one who won't let himself go to fat.
The Baron stopped in front of them, took Feyd-Rautha's arm in a possessive
grip, said, "My nephew, the na-Baron, Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen." And, turning his
baby-fat face toward Feyd-Rautha, he said, "The Count and Lady Fenring of whom
I've spoken."
Feyd-Rautha dipped his head with the required courtesy. He stared at the
Lady Fenring. She was golden-haired and willowy, her perfection of figure
clothed in a flowing gown of ecru--simple fitness of form without ornament.
Gray-green eyes stared back at him. She had that Bene Gesserit serene repose
about her that the young man found subtly disturbing.
"Um-m-m-m-ah-hm-m-m-m," said the Count. He studied Feyd-Rautha. "The, hm-mm-m, precise young man, ah, my . . . hm-m-m-m . . . dear?" The Count glanced at
the Baron. "My dear Baron, you say you've spoken of us to this precise young
man? What did you say?"
"I told my nephew of the great esteem our Emperor holds for you. Count
Fenring," the Baron said. And he thought: Mark him well, Feyd! A killer with the
manners of a rabbit--this is the most dangerous kind.
"Of course!" said the Count, and he smiled at his lady.
Feyd-Rautha found the man's actions and words almost insulting. They stopped
just short of something overt that would require notice. The young man focused
his attention on the Count: a small man, weak-looking. The face was weaselish
with overlarge dark eyes. There was gray at the temples. And his movements--he
moved a hand or turned his head one way, then he spoke another way. It was
difficult to follow.
"Um-m-m-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m, you come upon such, mm-m-m, preciseness so
rarely," the Count said, addressing the Baron's shoulder. "I . . . ah,
congratulate you on the hm-m-m perfection of your ah-h-h heir. In the light of
the hm-m-m elder, one might say."
"You are too kind," the Baron said. He bowed, but Feyd-Rautha noted that his
uncle's eyes did not agree with the courtesy.
"When you're mm-m-m ironic, that ah-h-h suggests you're hm-m-m-m thinking
deep thoughts," the Count said.
There he goes again, Feyd-Rautha thought. It sounds like he's being
insulting, but there's nothing you can call out for satisfaction.
Listening to the man gave Feyd-Rautha the feeling his head was being pushed
through mush . . . um-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m-m! Feyd-Rautha turned his attention back
to the Lady Fenring.
"We're ah-h-h taking up too much of this young man's time," she said. "I
understand he's to appear in the arena today."
By the houris of the Imperial hareem, she's a lovely one! Feyd-Rautha
thought. He said: "I shall make a kill for you this day, my Lady. I shall make
the dedication in the arena, with your permission."
She returned his stare serenely, but her voice carried whiplash as she said:
"You do not have my permission."
"Feyd!" the Baron said. And he thought: That imp! Does he want this deadly
Count to call him out?
But the Count only smiled and said: "Hm-m-m-m-um-m-m."
"You really must be getting ready for the arena, Feyd," the Baron said. "You
must be rested and not take any foolish risks."
Feyd-Rautha bowed, his face dark with resentment. "I'm sure everything will
be as you wish, Uncle." He nodded to Count Fenring. "Sir." To the lady: "My
Lady." And he turned, strode out of the hall, barely glancing at the knot of
Families Minor near the double doors.
"He's so young," the Baron sighed.
"Um-m-m-m-ah indeed hmmm," the Count said.

And the Lady Fenring thought: Can that be the young man the Reverend Mother
meant? Is that a bloodline we must preserve?
"We've more than an hour before going to the arena," the Baron sad. "Perhaps
we could have our little talk now, Count Fenring." He tipped his gross head to
the right. "There's a considerable amount of progress to be discussed."
And the Baron thought; Let us see now how the Emperors errand boy gets
across whatever message he carries without ever being so crass as to speak it
right out.
The Count spoke to his lady: "Um-m-m-m-ah-h-h-hm-m-m, you mm-m will ah-h-h
excuse us, my dear?"
"Each day, some time each hour, brings change," she said. "Mm-m-m-m." And
she smiled sweetly at the Baron before turning away. Her long skirts swished and
she walked with a straight-backed regal stride toward the double doors at the
end of the hall.
The Baron noted how all conversation among the Houses Minor there stopped at
her approach, how the eyes followed her. Bene Gesserit! the Baron thought. The
universe would be better rid of them all!
"There's a cone of silence between two of the pillars over here on our
left," the Baron said. "We can talk there without fear of being overheard." He
led the way with his waddling gait into the sound-deadening field, feeling the
noises of the keep become dull and distant.
The Count moved up beside the Baron, and they turned, facing the wall so
their lips could not be read.
"We're not satisfied with the way you ordered the Sardaukar off Arrakis,"
the Count said.
Straight talk! the Baron thought.
"The Sardaukar could not stay longer without risking that others would find
out how the Emperor helped me," the Baron said.
"But your nephew Rabban does not appear to be pressing strongly enough
toward a solution of the Fremen problem."
"What does the Emperor wish?" the Baron asked. "There cannot be more than a
handful of Fremen left on Arrakis. The southern desert is uninhabitable. The
northern desert is swept regularly by our patrols."
"Who says the southern desert is uninhabitable?"
"Your own planetologist said it, my dear Count."
"But Doctor Kynes is dead."
"Ah, yes . . . unfortunate, that."
"We've word from an overflight across the southern reaches," the Count said.
"There's evidence of plant life."
"Has the Guild then agreed to a watch from space?"
"You know better than that, Baron. The Emperor cannot legally post a watch
on Arrakis."
"And I cannot afford it," the Baron said. "Who made this overflight?"
"A . . . smuggler."
"Someone has lied to you, Count," the Baron said. "Smugglers cannot
navigate, the southern reaches any better than can Rabban's men. Storms, sandstatic, and all that, you know. Navigation markers are knocked out faster than
they can be installed."
"We'll discuss various types of static another time," the Count said.
Ah-h-h-h, the Baron thought. "Have you found some mistake in my accounting
then?" he demanded.
"When you imagine mistakes there can be no self-defense," the Count said.
He's deliberately trying to arouse my anger, the Baron thought. He took two
deep breaths to calm himself. He could smell his own sweat, and the harness of
the suspensors beneath his robe felt suddenly itchy and galling.
"The Emperor cannot be unhappy about the death of the concubine and the
boy," the Baron said. "They fled into the desert. There was a storm."
"Yes, there were so many convenient accidents," the Count agreed
"I do not like your tone, Count," the Baron said.
"Anger is one thing, violence another," the Count said. "Let me caution you:
Should an unfortunate accident occur to me here the Great Houses all would learn
what you did on Arrakis. They've long suspected how you do business."
"The only recent business I can recall," the Baron said, "was transportation
of several legions of Sardaukar to Arrakis."
"You think you could hold that over the Emperor's head?"
"I wouldn't think of it!"
The Count smiled. "Sardaukar commanders could be found who'd confess they
acted without orders because they wanted a battle with your Fremen scum."
"Many might doubt such a confession," the Baron said, but the threat
staggered him. Are Sardaukar truly that disciplined? he wondered.
"The Emperor does wish to audit your books," the Count said.
"Any time."
"You . . . ah . . . have no objections?"
"None. My CHOAM Company directorship will bear the closest scrutiny." And he
thought: Let him bring a false accusation against me and have it exposed. I
shall stand there, Promethean, saying: "Behold me, I am wronged. " Then let him
bring any other accusation against me, even a true one. The Great Houses will
not believe a second attack from an accuser once proved wrong.
"No doubt your books will bear the closest scrutiny," the Count muttered.
"Why is the Emperor so interested in exterminating the Fremen?" the Baron
asked.
"You wish the subject to be changed, eh?" The Count shrugged. "It is the
Sardaukar who wish it, not the Emperor. They needed practice in killing . . .
and they hate to see a task left undone."
Does he think to frighten me by reminding me that he is supported by
bloodthirsty killers? the Baron wondered.
"A certain amount of killing has always been an arm of business," the Baron
said, "but a line has to be drawn somewhere. Someone must be left to work the
spice."
The Count emitted a short, barking laugh. "You think you can harness the
Fremen?"
"There never were enough of them for that," the Baron said. "But the killing
has made the rest of my population uneasy. It's reaching the point where I'm
considering another solution to the Arrakeen problem, my dear Fenring. And I
must confess the Emperor deserves credit for the inspiration."
"Ah-h-h?"
"You see, Count, I have the Emperor's prison planet, Salusa Secundus, to
inspire me."
The Count stared at him with glittering intensity. "What possible connection
is there between Arrakis and Salusa Secundus?"
The Baron felt the alertness in Fenring's eyes, said: "No connection yet."
"Yet?"
"You must admit it'd be a way to develop a substantial work force on
Arrakis--use the place as a prison planet."
"You anticipate an increase in prisoners?"
"There has been unrest," the Baron admitted. "I've had to squeeze rather
severely, Fenring. After all, you know the price I paid that damnable Guild to
transport our mutual force to Arrakis. That money has to come from somewhere."
"I suggest you not use Arrakis as a prison planet without the Emperor's
permission, Baron."
"Of course not," the Baron said, and he wondered at the sudden chill in
Fenring's voice.
"Another matter," the Count said. "We learn that Duke Leto's Mentat, Thufir
Hawat, is not dead but in your employ."
"I could not bring myself to waste him," the Baron said.
"You lied to our Sardaukar commander when you said Hawat was dead."
"Only a white lie, my dear Count. I hadn't the stomach for a long argument
with the man."
"Was Hawat the real traitor?"
"Oh, goodness, no! It was the false doctor." The Baron wiped at perspiration
on his neck. "You must understand, Fenring, I was without a Mentat. You know
that. I've never been without a Mentat. It was most unsettling."
"How could you get Hawat to shift allegiance?"
"His Duke was dead." The Baron forced a smile. "There's nothing to fear from
Hawat, my dear Count. The Mentat's flesh has been impregnated with a latent
poison. We administer an antidote in his meals. Without the antidote, the poison
is triggered--he'd die in a few days."
"Withdraw the antidote," the Count said.
"But he's useful!"
"And he knows too many things no living man should know."
"You said the Emperor doesn't fear exposure."
"Don't play games with me, Baron!"
"When I see such an order above the Imperial seal I'll obey it," the Baron
said. "But I'll not submit to your whim."
"You think it whim?"
"What else can it be? The Emperor has obligations to me, too, Fenring. I rid
him of the troublesome Duke."
"With the help of a few Sardaukar."
"Where else would the Emperor have found a House to provide the disguising
uniforms to hide his hand in this matter?"
"He has asked himself the same question, Baron, but with a slightly
different emphasis."
The Baron studied Fenring, noting the stiffness of jaw muscles, the careful
control. "Ah-h-h, now," the Baron said. "I hope the Emperor doesn't believe he
can move against me in total secrecy."
"He hopes it won't become necessary."
"The Emperor cannot believe I threaten him!" The Baron permitted anger and
grief to edge his voice, thinking: Let him wrong me in that! I could place
myself on the throne while still beating my breast over how I'd been wronged.
The Count's voice went dry and remote as he said: "The Emperor believes what
his senses tell him."
"Dare the Emperor charge me with treason before a full Landsraad Council?"
And the Baron held his breath with the hope of it.
"The Emperor need dare nothing."
The Baron whirled away in his suspensors to hide his expression. It could
happen in my lifetime! he thought. Emperor! Let him wrong me! Then--the bribes
and coercion, the rallying of the Great Houses: they'd flock to my banner like
peasants running for shelter. The thing they fear above all else is the
Emperor's Sardaukar loosed upon them one House at a time.
"It's the Emperor's sincere hope he'll never have to charge you with
treason," the Count said.
The Baron found it difficult to keep irony out of his voice and permit only
the expression of hurt, but he managed. "I've been a most loyal subject. These
words hurt me beyond my capacity to express."
"Um-m-m-m-ah-hm-m-m," said the Count.
The Baron kept his back to the Count, nodding. Presently he said, "It's time
to go to the arena."
"Indeed," said the Count.
They moved out of the cone of silence and, side by side, walked toward the
clumps of Houses Minor at the end of the hall. A bell began a slow tolling
somewhere in the keep--twenty-minute warning for the arena gathering.

"The Houses Minor wait for you to lead them," the Count said, nodding toward
the people they approached.
Double meaning . . . double meaning, the Baron thought.
He looked up at the new talismans flanking the exit to his hall--the mounted
bull's head and the oil painting of the Old Duke Atreides, the late Duke Leto's
father. They filled the Baron with an odd sense of foreboding, and he wondered
what thoughts these talismans had inspired in the Duke Leto as they hung in the
halls of Caladan and then on Arrakis--the bravura father and the head of the
bull that had killed him.
"Mankind has ah only one mm-m-m science," the Count said as they picked up
their parade of followers and emerged from the hall into the waiting room--a
narrow space with high windows and floor of patterned white and purple tile.
"And what science is that?" the Baron asked.
"It's the um-m-m-ah-h science of ah-h-h discontent," the Count said.
The Houses Minor behind them, sheep-faced and responsive, laughed with just
the right tone of appreciation, but the sound carried a note of discord as it
collided with the sudden blast of motors that came to them when pages threw open
the outer doors, revealing the line of ground cars, their guidon pennants
whipping in a breeze.
The Baron raised his voice to surmount the sudden noise, said, "I hope
you'll not be discontented with the performance of my nephew today, Count
Fenring."
"I ah-h-h am filled um-m-m only with a hm-m-m sense of anticipation, yes,"
the Count said. "Always in the ah-h-h process verbal, one um-m-m ah-h-h must
consider the ah-h-h office of origin."
The Baron hid his sudden stiffening of surprise by stumbling on the first
step down from the exit. Process verbal! That was a report of a crime against
the Imperium!
But the Count chuckled to make it seem a joke, and patted the Baron's arm.
All the way to the arena, though, the Baron sat back among the armored
cushions of his car, casting covert glances at the Count beside him, wondering
why the Emperor's errand boy had thought it necessary to make that particular
kind of joke in front of the Houses Minor. It was obvious that Fenring seldom
did anything he felt to be unnecessary, or used two words where one would do, or
held himself to a single meaning in a single phrase.
They were seated in the golden box above the triangular arena--horns
blaring, the tiers above and around them jammed with a hubbub of people and
waving pennants--when the answer came to the Baron.
"My dear Baron," the Count said, leaning close to his ear, "you know, don't
you, that the Emperor has not given official sanction to your choice of heir?"
The Baron felt himself to be within a sudden personal cone of silence
produced by his own shock. He stared at Fenring, barely seeing the Count's lady
come through the guards beyond to join the party in the golden box.
"That's really why I'm here today," the Count said. "The Emperor wishes me
to report on whether you've chosen a worthy successor. There's nothing like the
arena to expose the true person from beneath the mask, eh?"
"The Emperor promised me free choice of heir!" the Baron grated.
"We shall see," Fenring said, and turned away to greet his lady. She sat
down, smiling at the Baron, then giving her attention to the sand floor beneath
them where Feyd-Rautha was emerging in giles and tights--the black glove and the
long knife in his right hand, the white glove and the short knife in his left
hand.
"White for poison, black for purity," the Lady Fenring said. "A curious
custom, isn't it, my love?"
"Um-m-m-m," the Count said.
The greeting cheer lifted from the family galleries, and Feyd-Rautha paused
to accept it, looking up and scanning the faces--seeing his cousines and
cousins, the demibrothers, the concubines and out-freyn relations. They were so
many pink trumpet mouths yammering amidst a flutter of colorful clothing and
banners.
It came to Feyd-Rautha then that the packed ranks of faces would look just
as avidly at his blood as at that of the slave-gladiator. There was not a doubt
of the outcome in this fight, of course. Here was only the form of danger
without its substance--yet . . .
Feyd-Rautha held up his knives to the sun, saluted the three corners of the
arena in the ancient manner. The short knife in white-gloved hand (white, the
sign of poison) went first into its sheath. Then the long blade in the blackgloved hand--the pure blade that now was unpure, his secret weapon to turn this
day into a purely personal victory: poison on the black blade.
The adjustment of his body shield took only a moment, and he paused to sense
the skin-tightening at his forehead assuring him he was properly guarded.
This moment carried its own suspense, and Feyd-Rautha dragged it out with
the sure hand of a showman, nodding to his handlers and distracters, checking
their equipment with a measuring stare--gyves in place with their prickles sharp
and glistening, the barbs and hooks waving with their blue streamers.
Feyd-Rautha signaled the musicians.
The slow march began, sonorous with its ancient pomp, and Feyd-Rautha led
his troupe across the arena for obeisance at the foot of his uncle's box. He
caught the ceremonial key as it was thrown.
The music stopped.
Into the abrupt silence, he stepped back two paces, raised the key and
shouted. "I dedicate this truth to . . . " And he paused, knowing his uncle
would think: The young fool's going to dedicate to Lady Fenring after all and
cause a ruckus!
" . . . to my uncle and patron, the Baron Vladimir Harkonnen!" Feyd-Rautha
shouted.
And he was delighted to see his uncle sigh.
The music resumed at the quick-march, and Feyd-Rautha led his men scampering
back across the arena to the prudence door that admitted only those wearing the
proper identification band. Feyd-Rautha prided himself that he never used the
pru-door and seldom needed distracters. But it was good to know they were
available this day--special plans sometimes involved special dangers.
Again, silence settled over the arena.
Feyd-Rautha turned, faced the big red door across from him through which the
gladiator would emerge.
The special gladiator.
The plan Thufir Hawat had devised was admirably simple and direct, FeydRautha thought. The slave would not be drugged--that was the danger. Instead, a
key word had been drummed into the man's unconscious to immobilize his muscles
at a critical instant. Feyd-Rautha rolled the vital word in his mind, mouthing
it without sound: "Scum!" To the audience, it would appear that an un-drugged
slave had been slipped into the arena to kill the na-Baron. And all the
carefully arranged evidence would point to the slavemaster.
A low humming arose from the red door's servomotors as they were armed for
opening.
Feyd-Rautha focused all his awareness on the door. This first moment was the
critical one. The appearance of the gladiator as he emerged told the trained eye
much it needed to know. All gladiators were supposed to be hyped on elacca drug
to come out kill-ready in fighting stance--but you had to watch how they hefted
the knife, which way they turned in defense, whether they were actually aware of
the audience in the stands. The way a slave cocked his head could give the most
vital clue to counter and feint.
The red door slammed open.

Out charged a tall, muscular man with shaved head and darkly pitted eyes.
His skin was carrot-colored as it should be from the elacca drug, but FeydRautha knew the color was paint. The slave wore green leotards and the red belt
of a semishield--the belt's arrow pointing left to indicate the slave's left
side was shielded. He held his knife sword-fashion, cocked slightly outward in
the stance of a trained fighter. Slowly, he advanced into the arena, turning his
shielded side toward Feyd-Rautha and the group at the pru-door.
"I like not the look of this one, "said one of Feyd-Rautha's barb-men. "Are
you sure he's drugged, m'Lord?"
"He has the color," Feyd-Rautha said.
"Yet he stands like a fighter," said another helper.
Feyd-Rautha advanced two steps onto the sand, studied this slave.
"What has he done to his arm?" asked one of the distracters.
Feyd-Rautha's attention went to a bloody scratch on the man's left forearm,
followed the arm down to the hand as it pointed to a design drawn in blood on
the left hip of the green leotards--a wet shape there: the formalized outline of
a hawk.
Hawk!
Feyd-Rautha looked up into the darkly pitted eyes, saw them glaring at him
with uncommon alertness.
It's one of Duke Leto's fighting men we took on Arrakis! Feyd-Rautha
thought. No simple gladiator this! A chill ran through him, and he wondered if
Hawat had another plan for this arena--a feint within a feint within a feint.
And only the slavemaster prepared to take the blame!
Feyd-Rautha's chief handler spoke at his ear: "I like not the look on that
one, m'Lord. Let me set a barb or two in his knife arm to try him."
"I'll set my own barbs," Feyd-Rautha said. He took a pair of the long,
hooked shafts from the handler, hefted them, testing the balance. These barbs,
too, were supposed to be drugged--but not this time, and the chief handler might
die because of that. But it was all part of the plan.
"You'll come out of this a hero," Hawat had said. "Killed your gladiator man
to man and in spite of treachery. The slavemaster will be executed and your man
will step into his spot."
Feyd-Rautha advanced another five paces into the arena, playing out the
moment, studying the slave. Already, he knew, the experts in the stands above
him were aware that something was wrong. The gladiator had the correct skin
color for a drugged man, but he stood his ground and did not tremble. The
aficionados would be whispering among themselves now: "See how he stands. He
should be agitated--attacking or retreating. See how he conserves his strength,
how he waits. He should not wait."
Feyd-Rautha felt his own excitement kindle. Let there be treachery in
Hawat's mind, he thought. I can handle this slave. And it's my long knife that
carries the poison this time, not the short one. Even Hawat doesn't know that.
"Hai, Harkonnen!" the slave called. "Are you prepared to die?"
Deathly stillness gripped the arena. Slaves did not issue the challenge!
Now, Feyd-Rautha had a clear view of the gladiator's eyes, saw the cold
ferocity of despair in them. He marked the way the man stood, loose and ready,
muscles prepared for victory. The slave grapevine had carried Hawat's message to
this one: "You'll get a true chance to kill the na-Baron." That much of the
scheme was as they'd planned it, then.
A tight smile crossed Feyd-Rautha's mouth. He lifted the barbs, seeing
success for his plans in the way the gladiator stood.
"Hai! Hai!" the slave challenged, and crept forward two steps.
No one in the galleries can mistake it now, Feyd-Rautha thought.
This slave should have been partly crippled by drug-induced terror. Every
movement should have betrayed his inner knowledge that there was no hope for
him--he could not win. He should have been filled with the stories of the
poisons the na-Baron chose for the blade in his white-gloved hand. The na-Baron
never gave quick death; he delighted in demonstrating rare poisons, could stand
in the arena pointing out interesting side effects on a writhing victim. There
was fear in the slave, yes--but not terror.
Feyd-Rautha lifted the barbs high, nodded in an almost-greeting.
The gladiator pounced.
His feint and defensive counter were as good as any Feyd-Rautha had ever
seen. A timed side blow missed by the barest fraction from severing the tendons
of the na-Baron's left leg.
Feyd-Rautha danced away, leaving a barbed shaft in the slave's right
forearm, the hooks completely buried in flesh where the man could not withdraw
them without ripping tendons.
A concerted gasp lifted from the galleries.
The sound filled Feyd-Rautha with elation.
He knew now what his uncle was experiencing, sitting up there with the
Fenrings, the observers from the Imperial Court, beside him. There could be no
interference with this fight. The forms must be observed in front of witnesses.
And the Baron would interpret the events in the arena only one way--threat to
himself.
The slave backed, holding knife in teeth and lashing the barbed shaft to his
arm with the pennant. "I do not feel your needle!" he shouted. Again he crept
forward, knife ready, left side presented, his body bent backward to give it the
greatest surface of protection from the half-shield.
That action, too, didn't escape the galleries. Sharp cries came from the
family boxes. Feyd-Rautha's handlers were calling out to ask if he needed them.
He waved them back to the pru-door.
I'll give them a show such as they've never had before, Feyd-Rautha thought.
No tame killing where they can sit back and admire the style. This'll be
something to take them by the guts and twist them. When I'm Baron they'll
remember this day and won't be a one of them can escape fear of me because of
this day.
Feyd-Rautha gave ground slowly before the gladiator's crablike advance.
Arena sand grated underfoot. He heard the slave's panting, smelled his own sweat
and a faint odor of blood on the air.
Steadily, the na-Baron moved backward, turning to the right, his second barb
ready. The slave danced sideways. Feyd-Rautha appeared to stumble, heard the
scream from the galleries.
Again, the slave pounced.
Gods, what a fighting man! Feyd-Rautha thought as he leaped aside. Only
youth's quickness saved him, but he left the second barb buried in the deltoid
muscle of the slave's right arm.
Shrill cheers rained from the galleries.
They cheer me now, Feyd-Rautha thought. He heard the wildness in the voices
just as Hawat had said he would. They'd never cheered a family fighter that way
before. And he thought with an edge of grimness on a thing Hawat had told him:
"It's easier to be terrified by an enemy you admire."
Swiftly, Feyd-Rautha retreated to the center of the arena where all could
see clearly. He drew his long blade, crouched and waited for the advancing
slave.
The man took only the time to lash the second barb tight to his arm, then
sped in pursuit.
Let the family see me do this thing, Feyd-Rautha thought. I am their enemy:
let them think of me as they see me now.
He drew his short blade.
"I do not fear you, Harkonnen swine," the gladiator said. "Your tortures
cannot hurt a dead man. I can be dead on my own blade before a handler lays
finger to my flesh. And I'll have you dead beside me!"
Feyd-Rautha grinned, offered now the long blade, the one with the poison.
"Try this one," he said, and feinted with the short blade in his other hand.
The slave shifted knife hands, turned inside both parry and feint to grapple
the na-Baron's short blade--the one in the white gloved hand that tradition said
should carry the poison.
"You will die, Harkonnen," the gladiator gasped.
They struggled sideways across the sand. Where Feyd-Rautha's shield met the
slave's halfshield, a blue glow marked the contact. The air around them filled
with ozone from the field.
"Die on your own poison!" the slave grated.
He began forcing the white-gloved hand inward, turning the blade he thought
carried the poison.
Let them see this! Feyd-Rautha thought. He brought down the long blade, felt
it clang uselessly against the barbed shaft lashed to the slave's arm.
Feyd-Rautha felt a moment of desperation. He had not thought the barbed
shafts would be an advantage for the slave. But they gave the man another
shield. And the strength of this gladiator! The short blade was being forced
inward inexorably, and Feyd-Rautha focused on the fact that a man could also die
on an unpoisoned blade.
"Scum!" Feyd-Rautha gasped.
At the key word, the gladiator's muscles obeyed with a momentary slackness.
It was enough for Feyd-Rautha. He opened a space between them sufficient for the
long blade. Its poisoned tip flicked out, drew a red line down the slave's
chest. There was instant agony in the poison. The man disengaged himself,
staggered backward.
Now, let my dear family watch, Feyd-Rautha thought. Let them think on this
slave who tried to turn the knife he thought poisoned and use it against me. Let
them wonder how a gladiator could come into this arena ready for such an
attempt. And let them always be aware they cannot know for sure which of my
hands carries the poison.
Feyd-Rautha stood in silence, watching the slowed motions of the slave. The
man moved within a hesitation-awareness. There was an orthographic thing on his
face now for every watcher to recognize. The death was written there. The slave
knew it had been done to him and he knew how it had been done. The wrong blade
had carried the poison.
"You!" the man moaned.
Feyd-Rautha drew back to give death its space. The paralyzing drug in the
poison had yet to take full effect, but the man's slowness told of its advance.
The slave staggered forward as though drawn by a string--one dragging step
at a time. Each step was the only step in his universe. He still clutched his
knife, but its point wavered.
"One day . . . one . . . of us . . . will . . . get . . . you," he gasped.
A sad little moue contorted his mouth. He sat, sagged, then stiffened and
rolled away from Feyd-Rautha, face down.
Feyd-Rautha advanced in the silent arena, put a toe under the gladiator and
rolled him onto his back to give the galleries a clear view of the face when the
poison began its twisting, wrenching work on the muscles. But the gladiator came
over with his own knife, protruding from his breast.
In spite of frustration, there was for Feyd-Rautha a measure of admiration
for the effort this slave had managed in overcoming the paralysis to do this
thing to himself. With the admiration came the realization that here was truly a
thing to fear.
That which makes a man superhuman is terrifying.
As he focused on this thought, Feyd-Rautha became conscious of the eruption
of noise from the stands and galleries around him. They were cheering with utter
abandon.
Feyd-Rautha turned, looking up at them.

All were cheering except the Baron, who sat with hand to chin in deep
contemplation--and the Count and his lady, both of whom were staring down at
him, their faces masked by smiles.
Count Fenring turned to his lady, said: "Ah-h-h-um-m-m, a resourceful um-mm-m young man. Eh, mm-m-m-ah, my dear?"
"His ah-h-h synaptic responses are very swift," she said.
The Baron looked at her, at the Count, returned his attention to the arena,
thinking: If someone could get that close to one of mine! Rage began to replace
his fear. I'll have the slavemaster dead over a slow fire this night . . . and
if this Count and his lady had a hand in it . . .
The conversation in the Baron's box was remote movement to Feyd-Rautha, the
voices drowned in the foot-stamping chant that came now from all around:
"Head! Head! Head! Head!"
The Baron scowled, seeing the way Feyd-Rautha turned to him. Languidly,
controlling his rage with difficulty, the Baron waved his hand toward the young
man standing in the arena beside the sprawled body of the slave. Give the boy a
head. He earned it by exposing the slavemaster.
Feyd-Rautha saw the signal of agreement, thought: They think they honor me.
Let them see what I think!
He saw his handlers approaching with a saw-knife to do the honors, waved
them back, repeated the gesture as they hesitated. They think they honor me with
just a head! he thought. He bent and crossed the gladiator's hands around the
protruding knife handle, then removed the knife and placed it in the limp hands.
It was done in an instant, and he straightened, beckoned his handlers. "Bury
this slave intact with his knife in his hands," he said. "The man earned it."
In the golden box, Count Fenring leaned close to the Baron, said: "A grand
gesture, that--true bravura. Your nephew has style as well as courage."
"He insults the crowd by refusing the head," the Baron muttered.
"Not at all," Lady Fenring said. She turned, looking up at the tiers around
them.
And the Baron noted the line of her neck--a truly lovely flowing of muscles-like a young boy's.
"They like what your nephew did," she said.
As the import of Feyd-Rautha's gesture penetrated to the most distant seats,
as the people saw the handlers carrying off the dead gladiator intact, the Baron
watched them and realized she had interpreted the reaction correctly. The people
were going wild, beating on each other, screaming and stamping.
The Baron spoke wearily. "I shall have to order a fete. You cannot send
people home like this, their energies unspent. They must see that I share their
elation." He gave a hand signal to his guard, and a servant above them dipped
the Harkonnen orange pennant over the box--once, twice, three times--signal for
a fete.
Feyd-Rautha crossed the arena to stand beneath the golden box, his weapons
sheathed, arms hanging at his sides. Above the undiminished frenzy of the crowd,
he called: "A fete, Uncle?"
The noise began to subside as people saw the conversation and waited.
"In your honor, Feyd!" the Baron called down. And again, he caused the
pennant to be dipped in signal.
Across the arena, the pru-barriers had been dropped and young men were
leaping down into the arena, racing toward Feyd-Rautha.
"You ordered the pru-shields dropped. Baron?" the Count asked.
"No one will harm the lad," the Baron said. "He's a hero."
The first of the charging mass reached Feyd-Rautha, lifted him on their
shoulders, began parading around the arena.
"He could walk unarmed and unshielded through the poorest quarters of Harko
tonight," the Baron said. "They'd give him the last of their food and drink just
for his company."
The Baron pushed himself from his chair, settled his weight into his
suspensors. "You will forgive me, please. There are matters that require my
immediate attention. The guard will see you to the keep."
The Count arose, bowed. "Certainly, Baron. We're looking forward to the
fete. I've ah-h-h-mm-m-m never seen a Harkonnen fete."
"Yes," the Baron said. "The fete." He turned, was enveloped by guards as he
stepped into the private exit from the box.
A guard captain bowed to Count Fenring. "Your orders, my Lord?"
"We will ah-h-h wait for the worst mm-m-m crush to um-m-m pass," the Count
said.
"Yes, m'Lord." The man bowed himself back three paces.
Count Fenring faced his lady, spoke again in their personal humming-code
tongue: "You saw it, of course?"
In the same humming tongue, she said: "The lad knew the gladiator wouldn't
be drugged. There was a moment of fear, yes, but no surprise."
"It was planned," he said. "The entire performance."
"Without a doubt."
"It stinks of Hawat."
"Indeed," she said.
"I demanded earlier that the Baron eliminate Hawat."
"That was an error, my dear."
"I see that now."
"The Harkonnens may have a new Baron ere long."
"If that's Hawat's plan."
"That will bear examination, true," she said.
"The young one will be more amenable to control."
"For us . . . after tonight," she said.
"You don't anticipate difficulty seducing him, my little brood-mother?"
"No, my love. You saw how he looked at me."
"Yes, and I can see now why we must have that bloodline."
"Indeed, and it's obvious we must have a hold on him. I'll plant deep in his
deepest self the necessary prana-bindu phrases to bend him."
"We'll leave as soon as possible--as soon as you're sure," he said.
She shuddered. "By all means. I should not want to bear a child in this
terrible place."
"The things we do in the name of humanity," he said.
"Yours is the easy part," she said.
"There are some ancient prejudices I overcome," he said. "They're quite
primordial, you know."
"My poor dear," she said, and patted his cheek. "You know this is the only
way to be sure of saving that bloodline."
He spoke in a dry voice: "I quite understand what we do."
"We won't fail," she said.
"Guilt starts as a feeling of failure," he reminded.
"There'll be no guilt," she said. "Hypno-ligation of that Feyd-Rautha's
psyche and his child in my womb--then we go."
"That uncle," he said. "Have you ever seen such distortion?"
"He's pretty fierce," she said, "but the nephew could well grow to be
worse."
"Thanks to that uncle. You know, when you think what this lad could've been
with some other upbringing--with the Atreides code to guide him, for example."
"It's sad, "she said.
"Would that we could've saved both the Atreides youth and this one. From
what I heard of that young Paul--a most admirable lad, good union of breeding
and training." He shook his head. "But we shouldn't waste sorrow over the
aristocracy of misfortune."
"There's a Bene Gesserit saying," she said.

"You have sayings for everything!" he protested.
"You'll like this one," she said. "It goes: 'Do not count a human dead until
you've seen his body. And even then you can make a mistake.' "

Muad'Dib tells us in "A Time of Reflection" that his first collisions with
Arrakeen necessities were the true beginnings of his education. He learned then
how to pole the sand for its weather, learned the language of the wind's needles
stinging his skin, learned how the nose can buzz with sand-itch and how to
gather his body's precious moisture around him to guard it and preserve it. As
his eyes assumed the blue of the Ibad, he learned the Chakobsa way.
-Stilgar's preface to "Muad'Dib, the Man" by the Princess Irulan
Stilgar's troop returning to the sietch with its two strays from the desert
climbed out of the basin in the waning light of the first moon. The robed
figures hurried with the smell of home in their nostrils. Dawn's gray line
behind them was brightest at the notch in their horizon-calendar that marked the
middle of autumn, the month of Caprock.
Wind-raked dead leaves strewed the cliffbase where the sietch children had
been gathering them, but the sounds of the troop's passage (except for
occasional blunderings by Paul and his mother) could not be distinguished from
the natural sounds of the night.
Paul wiped sweat-caked dust from his forehead, felt a tug at his arm, heard
Chani's voice hissing. "Do as I told you: bring the fold of your hood down over
your forehead! Leave only the eyes exposed. You waste moisture."
A whispered command behind them demanded silence: "The desert hears you!"
A bird chirruped from the rocks high above them.
The troop stopped, and Paul sensed abrupt tension.
There came a faint thumping from the rocks, a sound no louder than mice
jumping in the sand.
Again, the bird chirruped.
A stir passed through the troop's ranks. And again, the mouse-thumping
pecked its way across the sand.
Once more, the bird chirruped.
The troop resumed its climb up into a crack in the rocks, but there was a
stillness of breath about the Fremen now that filled Paul with caution, and he
noted covert glances toward Chani, the way she seemed to withdraw, pulling in
upon herself.
There was rock underfoot now, a faint gray swishing of robes around them,
and Paul sensed a relaxing of discipline, but still that quiet-of-the-person
about Chani and the others. He followed a shadow shape--up steps, a turn, more
steps, into a tunnel, past two moisture-sealed doors and into a globelighted
narrow passage with yellow rock walls and ceiling.
All around him, Paul saw the Fremen throwing back their hoods, removing nose
plugs, breathing deeply. Someone sighed. Paul looked for Chani, found that she
had left his side. He was hemmed in by a press of robed bodies. Someone jostled
him, said, "Excuse me, Usul. What a crush! It's always this way."
On his left, the narrow bearded face of the one called Farok turned toward
Paul. The stained eyepits and blue darkness of eyes appeared even darker under
the yellow globes. "Throw off your hood, Usul," Farok said. "You're home." And
he helped Paul, releasing the hood catch, elbowing a space around them.
Paul slipped out his nose plugs, swung the mouth baffle aside. The odor of
the place assailed him: unwashed bodies, distillate esters of reclaimed wastes,
everywhere the sour effluvia of humanity with, over it all, a turbulence of
spice and spicelike harmonics.
"Why are we waiting, Farok?" Paul asked.

"For the Reverend Mother, I think. You heard the message--poor Chani."
Poor Chani? Paul asked himself. He looked around, wondering where she was,
where his mother had got to in all this crush.
Farok took a deep breath. "The smells of home," he said.
Paul saw that the man was enjoying the stink of this air, that there was no
irony in his tone. He heard his mother cough then, and her voice came back to
him through the press of the troop: "How rich the odors of your sietch, Stilgar.
I see you do much working with the spice . . . you make paper . . . plastics . .
. and isn't that chemical explosives?"
"You know this from what you smell?" It was another man's voice.
And Paul realized she was speaking for his benefit, that she wanted him to
make a quick acceptance of this assault on his nostrils.
There came a buzz of activity at the head of the troop and a prolonged
indrawn breath that seemed to pass through the Fremen, and Paul heard hushed
voices back down the line: "It's true then--Liet is dead."
Liet, Paul thought. Then: Chani, daughter of Liet. The pieces fell together
in his mind. Liet was the Fremen name of the planetologist.
Paul looked at Farok, asked: "Is it the Liet known as Kynes?"
"There is only one Liet," Farok said.
Paul turned, stared at the robed back of a Fremen in front of him. Then
Liet-Kynes is dead, he thought.
"It was Harkonnen treachery," someone hissed. "They made it seem an accident
. . . lost in the desert . . . a 'thopter crash . . . "
Paul felt a burst of anger. The man who had befriended them, helped save
them from the Harkonnen hunters, the man who had sent his Fremen cohorts
searching for two strays in the desert . . . another victim of the Harkonnens.
"Does Usul hunger yet for revenge?" Farok asked.
Before Paul could answer, there came a low call and the troop swept forward
into a wider chamber, carrying Paul with them. He found himself in an open space
confronted by Stilgar and a strange woman wearing a flowing wraparound garment
of brilliant orange and green. Her arms were bare to the shoulders, and he could
see she wore no stillsuit. Her skin was a pale olive. Dark hair swept back from
her high forehead, throwing emphasis on sharp cheekbones and aquiline nose
between the dense darkness of her eyes.
She turned toward him, and Paul saw golden rings threaded with water tallies
dangling from her ears.
"This bested my Jamis?" she demanded.
"Be silent, Harah," Stilgar said. "It was Jamis' doing--he invoked the
tahaddi al-burhan."
"He's not but a boy!" she said. She gave her head a sharp shake from side to
side, setting the water tallies to jingling. "My children made fatherless by
another child? Surely, 'twas an accident!"
"Usul, how many years have you?" Stilgar asked.
"Fifteen standard," Paul said.
Stilgar swept his eyes over the troop. "Is there one among you cares to
challenge me?"
Silence.
Stilgar looked at the woman. "Until I've learned his weirding ways. I'd not
challenge him."
She returned his stare. "But--"
"You saw the stranger, woman who went with Chani to the Reverend Mother?"
Stilgar asked. "She's an out-freyn Sayyadina, mother to this lad. The mother and
son are masters of the weirding ways of battle."
"Lisan al-Gaib," the woman whispered. Her eyes held awe as she turned them
back toward Paul.
The legend again, Paul thought.

"Perhaps," Stilgar said. "It hasn't been tested, though." He returned his
attention to Paul. "Usul, it's our way that you've now the responsibility for
Jamis' woman here and for his two sons. His yali . . . his quarters, are yours.
His coffee service is yours . . . and this, his woman."
Paul studied the woman, wondering: Why isn't she mourning her man? Why does
she show no hate for me? Abruptly, he saw that the Fremen were staring at him,
waiting.
Someone whispered: "There's work to do. Say how you accept her."
Stilgar said: "Do you accept Harah as woman or servant?"
Harah lifted her arms, turning slowly on one heel. "I am still young, Usul.
It's said I still look as young as when I was with Geoff . . . before Jamis
bested him."
Jamis killed another to win her, Paul thought.
Paul said: "If I accept her as servant, may I yet change my mind at a later
time?"
"You'd have a year to change your decision," Stilgar said. "After that,
she's a free woman to choose as she wishes . . . or you could free her to choose
for herself at any time. But she's your responsibility, no matter what, for one
year . . . and you'll always share some responsibility for the sons of Jamis."
"I accept her as servant," Paul said.
Harah stamped a foot, shook her shoulders with anger. "But I'm young!"
Stilgar looked at Paul, said: "Caution's a worthy trait in a man who'd
lead."
"But I'm young!" Harah repeated.
"Be silent," Stilgar commanded. "If a thing has merit, it'll be. Show Usul
to his quarters and see he has fresh clothing and a place to rest."
"Oh-h-h-h!" she said.
Paul had registered enough of her to have a first approximation. He felt the
impatience of the troop, knew many things were being delayed here. He wondered
if he dared ask the whereabouts of his mother and Chani, saw from Stilgar's
nervous stance that it would be a mistake.
He faced Harah, pitched his voice with tone and tremolo to accent her fear
and awe, said: "Show me my quarters, Harah! We will discuss your youth another
time."
She backed away two steps, cast a frightened glance at Stilgar. "He has the
weirding voice," she husked.
"Stilgar," Paul said. "Chani's father put heavy obligation on me. If there's
anything . . . "
"It'll be decided in council," Stilgar said. "You can speak then." He nodded
in dismissal, turned away with the rest of the troop following him.
Paul took Harah's arm, noting how cool her flesh seemed, feeling her
tremble. "I'll not harm you, Harah," he said. "Show me our quarters." And he
smoothed his voice with relaxants.
"You'll not cast me out when the year's gone?" she said. "I know for true
I'm not as young as once I was."
"As long as I live you'll have a place with me," he said. He released her
arm. "Come now, where are our quarters?"
She turned, led the way down the passage, turning right into a wide cross
tunnel lighted by evenly spaced yellow overhead globes. The stone floor was
smooth, swept clean of sand.
Paul moved up beside her, studied the aquiline profile as they walked. "You
do not hate me, Harah?"
"Why should I hate you?"
She nodded to a cluster of children who stared at them from the raised ledge
of a side passage. Paul glimpsed adult shapes behind the children partly hidden
by filmy hangings.
"I . . . bested Jamis."
"Stilgar said the ceremony was held and you're a friend of Jamis." She
glanced sidelong at him. "Stilgar said you gave moisture to the dead. Is that
truth?"
"Yes."
"It's more than I'll do . . . can do."
"Don't you mourn him?"
"In the time of mourning, I'll mourn him."
They passed an arched opening. Paul looked through it at men and women
working with stand-mounted machinery in a large, bright chamber. There seemed an
extra tempo of urgency to them.
"What're they doing in there?" Paul asked.
She glanced back as they passed beyond the arch, said: "They hurry to finish
the quota in the plastics shop before we flee. We need many dew collectors for
the planting."
"Flee?"
"Until the butchers stop hunting us or are driven from our land."
Paul caught himself in a stumble, sensing an arrested instant of time,
remembering a fragment, a visual projection of prescience--but it was displaced,
like a montage in motion. The bits of his prescient memory were not quite as he
remembered them.
"The Sardaukar hunt us," he said.
"They'll not find much excepting an empty sietch or two," she said. "And
they'll find their share of death in the sand."
"They'll find this place?" he asked.
"Likely."
"Yet we take the time to . . . " He motioned with his head toward the arch
now far behind them. " . . . make . . . dew collectors?"
"The planting goes on."
"What're dew collectors?" he asked.
The glance she turned on him was full of surprise. "Don't they teach you
anything in the . . . wherever it is you come from?"
"Not about dew collectors."
"Hai!" she said, and there was a whole conversation in the one word.
"Well, what are they?"
"Each bush, each weed you see out there in the erg," she said, "how do you
suppose it lives when we leave it? Each is planted most tenderly in its own
little pit. The pits are filled with smooth ovals of chromoplastic. Light turns
them white. You can see them glistening in the dawn if you look down from a high
place. White reflects. But when Old Father Sun departs, the chromoplastic
reverts to transparency in the dark. It cools with extreme rapidity. The surface
condenses moisture out of the air. That moisture trickles down to keep our
plants alive."
"Dew collectors," he muttered, enchanted by the simple beauty of such a
scheme.
"I'll mourn Jamis in the proper time for it," she said, as though her mind
had not left his other question. "He was a good man, Jamis, but quick to anger.
A good provider, Jamis, and a wonder with the children. He made no separation
between Geoff's boy, my firstborn, and his own true son. They were equal in his
eyes." She turned a questing stare on Paul. "Would it be that way with you,
Usul?"
"We don't have that problem."
"But if--"
"Harah!"
She recoiled at the harsh edge in his voice.
They passed another brightly lighted room visible through an arch on their
left. "What's made there?" he asked.

"They repair the weaving machinery," she said. "But it must be dismantled by
tonight." She gestured at a tunnel branching to their left. "Through there and
beyond, that's food processing and stillsuit maintenance." She looked at Paul.
"Your suit looks new. But if it needs work, I'm good with suits. I work in the
factory in season."
They began coming on knots of people now and thicker clusterings of openings
in the tunnel's sides. A file of men and women passed them carrying packs that
gurgled heavily, the smell of spice strong about them.
"They'll not get our water," Harah said. "Or our spice. You can be sure of
that."
Paul glanced at the openings in the tunnel walls, seeing the heavy carpets
on the raised ledge, glimpses of rooms with bright fabrics on the walls, piled
cushions. People in the openings fell silent at their approach, followed Paul
with untamed stares.
"The people find it strange you bested Jamis," Harah said. "Likely you'll
have some proving to do when we're settled in a new sietch."
"I don't like killing," he said.
"Thus Stilgar tells it," she said, but her voice betrayed her disbelief.
A shrill chanting grew louder ahead of them. They came to another side
opening wider than any of the others Paul had seen. He slowed his pace, staring
in at a room crowded with children sitting cross-legged on a maroon-carpeted
floor.
At a chalkboard against the far wall stood a woman in a yellow wraparound, a
projecto-stylus in one hand. The board was filled with designs--circles, wedges
and curves, snake tracks and squares, flowing arcs split by parallel lines. The
woman pointed to the designs one after the other as fast as she could move the
stylus, and the children chanted in rhythm with her moving hand.
Paul listened, hearing the voices grow dimmer behind as he moved deeper into
the sietch with Harah.
"Tree," the children chanted. "Tree, grass, dune, wind, mountain, hill,
fire, lightning, rock, rocks, dust, sand, heat, shelter, heat, full, winter,
cold, empty, erosion, summer, cavern, day, tension, moon, night, caprock,
sandtide, slope, planting, binder . . . "
"You conduct classes at a time like this?" Paul asked.
Her face went somber and grief edged her voice: "What Liet taught us, we
cannot pause an instant in that. Liet who is dead must not be forgotten. It's
the Chakobsa way."
She crossed the tunnel to the left, stepped up onto a ledge, parted gauzy
orange hangings and stood aside: "Your yali is ready for you, Usul."
Paul hesitated before joining her on the ledge. He felt a sudden reluctance
to be alone with this woman. It came to him that he was surrounded by a way of
life that could only be understood by postulating an ecology of ideas and
values. He felt that this Fremen world was fishing for him, trying to snare him
in its ways. And he knew what lay in that snare--the wild jihad, the religious
war he felt he should avoid at any cost.
"This is your yali," Harah said. "Why do you hesitate?"
Paul nodded, joined her on the ledge. He lifted the hangings across from
her, feeling metal fibers in the fabric, followed her into a short entrance way
and then into a larger room, square, about six meters to a side--thick blue
carpets on the floor, blue and green fabrics hiding the rock walls, glowglobes
tuned to yellow overhead bobbing against draped yellow ceiling fabrics.
The effect was that of an ancient tent.
Harah stood in front of him, left hand on hip, her eyes studying his face.
"The children are with a friend," she said. "They will present themselves
later."
Paul masked his unease beneath a quick scanning of the room. Thin hangings
to the right, he saw, partly concealed a larger room with cushions piled around
the walls. He felt a soft breeze from an air duct, saw the outlet cunningly
hidden in a pattern of hangings directly ahead of him.
"Do you wish me to help you remove your stillsuit?" Harah asked.
"No . . . thank you."
"Shall I bring food?"
"Yes."
"There is a reclamation chamber off the other room." She gestured. "For your
comfort and convenience when you're out of your stillsuit."
"You said we have to leave this sietch," Paul said. "Shouldn't we be packing
or something?"
"It will be done in its time," she said. "The butchers have yet to penetrate
to our region."
Still she hesitated, staring at him.
"What is it?" he demanded.
"You've not the eyes of the Ibad," she said. "It's strange but not entirely
unattractive."
"Get the food," he said. "I'm hungry."
She smiled at him--a knowing, woman's smile that he found disquieting. "I am
your servant," she said, and whirled away in one lithe motion, ducking behind a
heavy wall hanging that revealed another passage before falling back into place.
Feeling angry with himself, Paul brushed through the thin hanging on the
right and into the larger room. He stood there a moment caught by uncertainty.
And he wondered where Chani was . . . Chani who had just lost her father.
We're alike in that, he thought.
A wailing cry sounded from the outer corridors, its volume muffled by the
intervening hangings. It was repeated, a bit more distant. And again. Paul
realized someone was calling the time. He focused on the fact that he had seen
no clocks.
The faint smell of burning creosote bush came to his nostrils, riding on the
omnipresent stink of the sietch. Paul saw that he had already suppressed the
odorous assault on his senses.
And he wondered again about his mother, how the moving montage of the future
would incorporate her . . . and the daughter she bore. Mutable time-awareness
danced around him. He shook his head sharply, focusing his attention on the
evidences that spoke of profound depth and breadth in this Fremen culture that
had swallowed them.
With its subtle oddities.
He had seen a thing about the caverns and this room, a thing that suggested
far greater differences than anything he had yet encountered.
There was no sign of a poison snooper here, no indication of their use
anywhere in the cave warren. Yet he could smell poisons in the sietch stench-strong ones, common ones.
He heard a rustle of hangings, thought it was Harah returning with food, and
turned to watch her. Instead, from beneath a displaced pattern of hangings, he
saw two young boys--perhaps aged nine and ten--staring out at him with greedy
eyes. Each wore a small kindjal-type of crysknife, rested a hand on the hilt.
And Paul recalled the stories of the Fremen--that their children fought as
ferociously as the adults.

-description from "A Manual of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
Phosphortubes in the faraway upper reaches of the cavern cast a dim light
onto the thronged interior, hinting at the great size of this rock-enclosed
space . . . larger, Jessica saw, than even the Gathering Hall of her Bene
Gesserit school. She estimated there were more than five thousand people
gathered out there beneath the ledge where she stood with Stilgar.
And more were coming.
The air was murmurous with people.
"Your son has been summoned from his rest, Sayyadina," Stilgar said. "Do you
wish him to share in your decision?"
"Could he change my decision?"
"Certainly, the air with which you speak comes from your own lungs, but--"
"The decision stands," she said.
But she felt misgivings, wondering if she should use Paul as an excuse for
backing out of a dangerous course. There was an unborn daughter to think of as
well. What endangered the flesh of the mother endangered the flesh of the
daughter.
Men came with rolled carpets, grunting under the weight of them, stirring up
dust as the loads were dropped onto the ledge.
Stilgar took her arm, led her back into the acoustical horn that formed the
rear limits of the ledge. He indicated a rock bench within the horn. "The
Reverend Mother will sit here, but you may rest yourself until she comes."
"I prefer to stand," Jessica said.
She watched the men unroll the carpets, covering the ledge, looked out at
the crowd. There were at least ten thousand people on the rock floor now.
And still they came.
Out on the desert, she knew, it already was red nightfall, but here in the
cavern hall was perpetual twilight, a gray vastness thronged with people come to
see her risk her life.
A way was opened through the crowd to her right, and she saw Paul
approaching flanked by two small boys. There was a swaggering air of selfimportance about the children. They kept hands on knives, scowled at the wall of
people on either side.
"The sons of Jamis who are now the sons of Usul," Stilgar said. "They take
their escort duties seriously." He ventured a smile at Jessica.
Jessica recognized the effort to lighten her mood and was grateful for it,
but could not take her mind from the danger that confronted her.
I had no choice but to do this, she thought. We must move swiftly if we're
to secure our place among these Fremen.
Paul climbed to the ledge, leaving the children below. He stopped in front
of his mother, glanced at Stilgar, back to Jessica. "What is happening? I
thought I was being summoned to council."
Stilgar raised a hand for silence, gestured to his left where another way
had been opened in the throng. Chani came down the lane opened there, her elfin
face set in lines of grief. She had removed her stillsuit and wore a graceful
blue wraparound that exposed her thin arms. Near the shoulder on her left arm, a
green kerchief had been tied.
Green for mourning, Paul thought.
It was one of the customs the two sons of Jamis had explained to him by
indirection, telling him they wore no green because they accepted him as
guardian-father.
"Are you the Lisan al-Gaib?" they had asked. And Paul had sensed the jihad
in their words, shrugged off the question with one of his own--learning then
that Kaleff, the elder of the two, was ten, and the natural son of Geoff. Orlop,
the younger, was eight, the natural son of Jamis.
It had been a strange day with these two standing guard over him because he
asked it, keeping away the curious, allowing him the time to nurse his thoughts
and prescient memories, to plan a way to prevent the jihad.

Now, standing beside his mother on the cavern ledge and looking out at the
throng, he wondered if any plan could prevent the wild outpouring of fanatic
legions.
Chani, nearing the ledge, was followed at a distance by four women carrying
another woman in a litter.
Jessica ignored Chani's approach, focusing all her attention on the woman in
the litter--a crone, a wrinkled and shriveled ancient thing in a black gown with
hood thrown back to reveal the tight knot of gray hair and the stringy neck.
The litter-carriers deposited their burden gently on the ledge from below,
and Chani helped the old woman to her feet.
So this is their Reverend Mother, Jessica thought.
The old woman leaned heavily on Chani as she hobbled toward Jessica, looking
like a collection of sticks draped in the black robe. She stopped in front of
Jessica, peered upward for a long moment before speaking in a husky whisper.
"So you're the one." The old head nodded once precariously on the thin neck.
"The Shadout Mapes was right to pity you."
Jessica spoke quickly, scornfully: "I need no one's pity."
"That remains to be seen," husked the old woman. She turned with surprising
quickness and faced the throng. "Tell them, Stilgar."
"Must I?" he asked.
"We are the people of Misr," the old woman rasped. "Since our Sunni
ancestors fled from Nilotic al-Ourouba, we have known flight and death. The
young go on that our people shall not die."
Stilgar took a deep breath, stepped forward two paces.
Jessica felt the hush come over the crowded cavern--some twenty thousand
people now, standing silently, almost without movement. It made her feel
suddenly small and filled with caution.
"Tonight we must leave this sietch that has sheltered us for so long and go
south into the desert," Stilgar said. His voice boomed out across the uplifted
faces, reverberating with the force given it by the acoustical horn behind the
ledge.
Still the throng remained silent.
"The Reverend Mother tells me she cannot survive another hajra," Stilgar
said. "We have lived before without a Reverend Mother, but it is not good for
people to seek a new home in such straits."
Now, the throng stirred, rippling with whispers and currents of disquiet.
"That this may not come to pass," Stilgar said, "our new Sayyadina Jessica
of the Weirding, has consented to enter the rite at this time. She will attempt
to pass within that we not lose the strength of our Reverend Mother."
Jessica of the Weirding, Jessica thought. She saw Paul staring at her, his
eyes filled with questions, but his mouth held silent by all the strangeness
around them.
If I die in the attempt, what will become of him? Jessica asked herself.
Again she felt the misgivings fill her mind.
Chani led the old Reverend Mother to a rock bench deep in the acoustical
horn, returned to stand beside Stilgar.
"That we may not lose all if Jessica of the Weirding should fail," Stilgar
said, "Chani, daughter of Liet, will be consecrated in the Sayyadina at this
time." He stepped one pace to the side.
From deep in the acoustical horn, the old woman's voice came out to them, an
amplified whisper, harsh and penetrating: "Chani has returned from her hajra-Chani has seen the waters."
A sussurant response arose from the crowd: "She has seen the waters."
"I consecrate the daughter of Liet in the Sayyadina," husked the old woman.
"She is accepted," the crowd responded.
Paul barely heard the ceremony, his attention still centered on what had
been said of his mother.

If she should fail?
He turned and looked back at the one they called Reverend Mother, studying
the dried crone features, the fathomless blue fixation of her eyes. She looked
as though a breeze would blow her away, yet there was that about her which
suggested she might stand untouched in the path of a coriolis storm. She carried
the same aura of power that he remembered from the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen
Mohiam who had tested him with agony in the way of the gom jabbar.
"I, the Reverend Mother Ramallo, whose voice speaks as a multitude, say this
to you," the old woman said. "It is fitting that Chani enter the Sayyadina."
"It is fitting," the crowd responded.
The old woman nodded, whispered: "I give her the silver skies, the golden
desert and its shining rocks, the green fields that will be. I give these to
Sayyadina Chani. And lest she forget that she's servant of us all, to her fall
the menial tasks in this Ceremony of the Seed. Let it be as Shai-hulud will have
it." She lifted a brown-stick arm, dropped it.
Jessica, feeling the ceremony close around her with a current that swept her
beyond all turning back, glanced once at Paul's question filled face, then
prepared herself for the ordeal.
"Let the watermasters come forward," Chani said with only the slightest
quaver of uncertainty in her girl-child voice.
Now, Jessica felt herself at the focus of danger, knowing its presence in
the watchfulness of the throng, in the silence.
A band of men made its way through a serpentine path opened in the crowd,
moving up from the back in pairs. Each pair carried a small skin sack, perhaps
twice the size of a human head. The sacks sloshed heavily.
The two leaders deposited their load at Chani's feet on the ledge and
stepped back.
Jessica looked at the sack, then at the men. They had their hoods thrown
back, exposing long hair tied in a roll at the base of the neck. The black pits
of their eyes stared back at her without wavering.
A furry redolence of cinnamon arose from the sack, wafted across Jessica.
The spice? she wondered.
"Is there water?" Chani asked.
The watermaster on the left, a man with a purple scar line across the bridge
of his nose, nodded once. "There is water, Sayyadina," he said, "but we cannot
drink of it."
"Is there seed?" Chani asked.
"There is seed," the man said.
Chani knelt and put her hands to the sloshing sack. "Blessed is the water
and its seed."
There was familiarity to the rite, and Jessica looked back at the Reverend
Mother Ramallo. The old woman's eyes were closed and she sat hunched over as
though asleep.
"Sayyadina Jessica," Chani said.
Jessica turned to see the girl staring up at her.
"Have you tasted the blessed water?" Chani asked.
Before Jessica could answer, Chani said: "It is not possible that you have
tasted the blessed water. You are outworlder and unprivileged."
A sigh passed through the crowd, a sussuration of robes that made the nape
hairs creep on Jessica's neck.
"The crop was large and the maker has been destroyed," Chani said. She began
unfastening a coiled spout fixed to the top of the sloshing sack.
Now, Jessica felt the sense of danger boiling around her. She glanced at
Paul, saw that he was caught up in the mystery of the ritual and had eyes only
for Chani.

Has he seen this moment in time? Jessica wondered. She rested a hand on her
abdomen, thinking of the unborn daughter there, asking herself: Do I have the
right to risk us both?
Chani lifted the spout toward Jessica, said: "Here is the Water of Life, the
water that is greater than water--Kan, the water that frees the soul. If you be
a Reverend Mother, it opens the universe to you. Let Shai-hulud judge now."
Jessica felt herself torn between duty to her unborn child and duty to Paul.
For Paul, she knew, she should take that spout and drink of the sack's contents,
but as she bent to the proffered spout, her senses told her its peril.
The stuff in the sack had a bitter smell subtly akin to many poisons that
she knew, but unlike them, too.
"You must drink it now," Chani said.
There's no turning back, Jessica reminded herself. But nothing in all her
Bene Gesserit training came into her mind to help her through this instant.
What is it? Jessica asked, herself. Liquor? A drug?
She bent over the spout, smelled the esters of cinnamon, remembering then
the drunkenness of Duncan Idaho. Spice liquor? she asked herself. She took the
siphon tube in her mouth, pulled up only the most minuscule sip. It tasted of
the spice, a faint bite acrid on the tongue.
Chani pressed down on the skin bag. A great gulp of the stuff surged into
Jessica's mouth and before she could help herself, she swallowed it, fighting to
retain her calmness and dignity.
"To accept a little death is worse than death itself," Chani said. She
stared at Jessica, waiting.
And Jessica stared back, still holding the spout in her mouth. She tasted
the sack's contents in her nostrils, in the roof of her mouth, in her cheeks, in
her eyes--a biting sweetness, now.
Cool.
Again, Chani sent the liquid gushing into Jessica's mouth.
Delicate.
Jessica studied Chani's face--elfin features--seeing the traces of LietKynes there as yet unfixed by time.
This is a drug they feed me, Jessica told herself.
But it was unlike any other drug of her experience, and Bene Gesserit
training included the taste of many drugs.
Chani's features were so clear, as though outlined in light.
A drug.
Whirling silence settled around Jessica. Every fiber of her body accepted
the fact that something profound had happened to it. She felt that she was a
conscious mote, smaller than any subatomic particle, yet capable of motion and
of sensing her surroundings. Like an abrupt revelation--the curtains whipped
away--she realized she had become aware of a psychokinesthetic extension of
herself. She was the mote, yet not the mote.
The cavern remained around her--the people. She sensed them: Paul, Chani,
Stilgar, the Reverend Mother Ramallo.
Reverend Mother!
At the school there had been rumors that some did not survive the Reverend
Mother ordeal, that the drug took them.
Jessica focused her attention on the Reverend Mother Ramallo, aware now that
all this was happening in a frozen instant of time--suspended time for her
alone.
Why is time suspended? she asked herself. She stared at the frozen
expressions around her, seeing a dust mote above Chani's head, stopped there.
Waiting.
The answer to this instant came like an explosion in her consciousness: her
personal time was suspended to save her life.

She focused on the psychokinesthetic extension of herself, looking within,
and was confronted immediately with a cellular core, a pit of blackness from
which she recoiled.
That is the place where we cannot look, she thought. There is the place the
Reverend Mothers are so reluctant to mention--the place where only a Kwisatz
Haderach may look.
This realization returned a small measure of confidence, and again she
ventured to focus on the psychokinesthetic extension, becoming a mote-self that
searched within her for danger.
She found it within the drug she had swallowed.
The stuff was dancing particles within her, its motions so rapid that even
frozen time could not stop them. Dancing particles. She began recognizing
familiar structures, atomic linkages: a carbon atom here, helical wavering . . .
a glucose molecule. An entire chain of molecules confronted her, and she
recognized a protein . . . a methyl-protein configuration.
Ah-h-h!
It was a soundless mental sigh within her as she saw the nature of the
poison.
With her psychokinesthetic probing, she moved into it, shifted an oxygen
mote, allowed another carbon mote to link, reattached a linkage of oxygen . . .
hydrogen.
The change spread . . . faster and faster as the catalyzed reaction opened
its surface of contact.
The suspension of time relaxed its hold upon her, and she sensed motion. The
tube spout from the sack was touched to her mouth--gently, collecting a drop of
moisture.
Chani's taking the catalyst from my body to change the poison in that sack,
Jessica thought. Why?
Someone eased her to a sitting position. She saw the old Reverend Mother
Ramallo being brought to sit beside her on the carpeted ledge. A dry hand
touched her neck.
And there was another psychokinesthetic mote within her awareness! Jessica
tried to reject it, but the mote swept closer . . . closer.
They touched!
It was like an ultimate simpatico, being two people at once: not telepathy,
but mutual awareness.
With the old Reverend Mother!
But Jessica saw that the Reverend Mother didn't think of herself as old. An
image unfolded before the mutual mind's eye: a young girl with a dancing spirit
and tender humor.
Within the mutual awareness, the young girl said, "Yes, that is how I am."
Jessica could only accept the words, not respond to them.
"You'll have it all soon, Jessica," the inward image said.
This is hallucination, Jessica told herself.
"You know better than that," the inward image said. "Swiftly now, do not
fight me. There isn't much time. We . . . " There came a long pause, then; "You
should've told us you were pregnant!"
Jessica found the voice that talked within the mutual awareness. "Why?"
"This changes both of you! Holy Mother, what have we done?"
Jessica sensed a forced shift in the mutual awareness, saw another motepresence with the inward eye. The other mote darted wildly here, there,
circling. It radiated pure terror.
"You'll have to be strong," the old Reverend Mother's image-presence said.
"Be thankful it's a daughter you carry. This would've killed a male fetus. Now .
. . carefully, gently . . . touch your daughter-presence. Be your daughterpresence. Absorb the fear . . . soothe . . . use your courage and your strength
. . . gently now . . . gently . . . "
The other whirling mote swept near, and Jessica compelled herself to touch
it.
Terror threatened to overwhelm her.
She fought it the only way she knew: "I shall not fear. Fear is the mind
killer . . . "
The litany brought a semblance of calm. The other mote lay quiescent against
her.
Words won't work, Jessica told herself.
She reduced herself to basic emotional reactions, radiated love, comfort, a
warm snuggling of protection.
The terror receded.
Again, the presence of the old Reverend Mother asserted itself, but now
there was a tripling of mutual awareness--two active and one that lay quietly
absorbing.
"Time compels me," the Reverend Mother said within the awareness. "I have
much to give you. And I do not know if your daughter can accept all this while
remaining sane. But it must be: the needs of the tribe are paramount."
"What--"
"Remain silent and accept!"
Experiences began to unroll before Jessica. It was like a lecture strip in a
subliminal training projector at the Bene Gesserit school . . . but faster . . .
blindingly faster.
Yet . . . distinct.
She knew each experience as it happened: there was a lover--virile, bearded,
with the Fremen eyes, and Jessica saw his strength and tenderness, all of him in
one blink-moment, through the Reverend Mother's memory.
There was no time now to think of what this might be doing to the daughter
fetus, only time to accept and record. The experiences poured in on Jessica-birth, life, death--important matters and unimportant, an outpouring of singleview time.
Why should a fall of sand from a clifftop stick in the memory? she asked
herself.
Too late, Jessica saw what was happening: the old woman was dying and, in
dying, pouring her experiences into Jessica's awareness as water is poured into
a cup. The other mote faded back into pre-birth awareness as Jessica watched it.
And, dying-in-conception, the old Reverend Mother left her life in Jessica's
memory with one last sighing blur of words.
"I've been a long time waiting for you," she said. "Here is my life."
There it was, encapsuled, all of it.
Even the moment of death.
I am now a Reverend Mother, Jessica realized.
And she knew with a generalized awareness that she had become, in truth,
precisely what was meant by a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. The poison drug had
transformed her.
This wasn't exactly how they did it at the Bene Gesserit school, she knew.
No one had ever introduced her to the mysteries of it, but she knew.
The end result was the same.
Jessica sensed the daughter-mote still touching her inner awareness, probed
it without response.
A terrible sense of loneliness crept through Jessica in the realization of
what had happened to her. She saw her own life as a pattern that had slowed and
all life around her speeded up so that the dancing interplay became clearer.
The sensation of mote-awareness faded slightly, its intensity easing as her
body relaxed from the threat of the poison, but still she felt that other mote,
touching it with a sense of guilt at what she had allowed to happen to it.
I did it, my poor, unformed, dear little daughter, I brought you into this
universe and exposed your awareness to all its varieties without any defenses.

A tiny outflowing of love-comfort, like a reflection of what she had poured
into it, came from the other mote.
Before Jessica could respond, she felt the adab presence of demanding
memory. There was something that needed doing. She groped for it, realizing she
was being impeded by a muzziness of the changed drug permeating her senses.
I could change that, she thought. I could take away the drug action and make
it harmless. But she sensed this would be an error. I'm within a rite of
joining.
Then she knew what she had to do.
Jessica opened her eyes, gestured to the watersack now being held above her
by Chani.
"It has been blessed," Jessica said. "Mingle the waters, let the change come
to all, that the people may partake and share in the blessing."
Let the catalyst do its work, she thought. Let the people drink of it and
have their awareness of each other heightened for awhile. The drug is safe now .
. . now that a Reverend Mother has changed it.
Still, the demanding memory worked on her, thrusting. There was another
thing she had to do, she realized, but the drug made it difficult to focus.
Ah-h-h-h-h . . . the old Reverend Mother.
"I have met the Reverend Mother Ramallo," Jessica said. "She is gone, but
she remains. Let her memory be honored in the rite.
Now, where did I get those words? Jessica wondered.
And she realized they came from another memory, the life that had been given
to her and now was part of herself. Something about that gift felt incomplete,
though.
"Let them have their orgy," the other-memory said within her. "They've
little enough pleasure out of living. Yes, and you and I need this little time
to become acquainted before I recede and pour out through your memories.
Already, I feel myself being tied to bits of you. Ah-h-h, you've a mind filled
with interesting things. So many things I'd never imagined."
And the memory-mind encapsulated within her opened itself to Jessica,
permitting a view down a wide corridor to other Reverend Mothers until there
seemed no end to them.
Jessica recoiled, fearing she would become lost in an ocean of oneness.
Still, the corridor remained, revealing to Jessica that the Fremen culture was
far older than she had suspected.
There had been Fremen on Poritrin, she saw, a people grown soft with an easy
planet, fair game for Imperial raiders to harvest and plant human colonies on
Bela Tegeuse and Salusa Secundus.
Oh, the wailing Jessica sensed in that parting.
Far down the corridor, an image-voice screamed: "They denied us the Hajj!"
Jessica saw the slave cribs on Bela Tegeuse down that inner corridor, saw
the weeding out and the selecting that spread men to Rossak and Harmonthep.
Scenes of brutal ferocity opened to her like the petals of a terrible flower.
And she saw the thread of the past carried by Sayyadina after Sayyadina--first
by word of mouth, hidden in the sand chanteys, then refined through their own
Reverend Mothers with the discovery of the poison drug on Rossak . . . and now
developed to subtle strengthen Arrakis in the discovery of the Water of Life.
Far down the inner corridor, another voice screamed: "Never to forgive!
Never to forget!"
But Jessica's attention was focused on the revelation of the Water of Life,
seeing its source: the liquid exhalation of a dying sandworm, a maker. And as
she saw the killing of it in her new memory, she suppressed a gasp.
The creature was drowned!
"Mother, are you all right?"
Paul's voice intruded on her, and Jessica struggled out of the inner
awareness to stare up at him, conscious of duty to him, but resenting his
presence.
I'm like a person whose hands were kept numb, without sensation from the
first moment of awareness--until one day the ability to feel is forced into
them.
The thought hung in her mind, an enclosing awareness.
And I say: "Look! I have no hands!" But the people all around me say: "What
are hands?" "
"Are you all right?" Paul repeated.
"Yes."
"Is this all right for me to drink?" He gestured to the sack in Chani's
hands. "They want me to drink it."
She heard the hidden meaning in his words, realized he had detected the
poison in the original, unchanged substance, that he was concerned for her. It
occurred to Jessica then to wonder about the limits of Paul's prescience. His
question revealed much to her.
"You may drink it," she said. "It has been changed." And she looked beyond
him to see Stilgar staring down at her, the dark-dark eyes studying.
"Now, we know you cannot be false," he said.
She sensed hidden meaning here, too, but the muzziness of the drug was
overpowering her senses. How warm it was and soothing. How beneficent these
Fremen to bring her into the fold of such companionship.
Paul saw the drug take hold of his mother.
He searched his memory--the fixed past, the flux-lines of the possible
futures. It was like scanning through arrested instants of time, disconcerting
to the lens of the inner eye. The fragments were difficult to understand when
snatched out of the flux.
This drug--he could assemble knowledge about it, understand what it was
doing to his mother, but the knowledge lacked a natural rhythm, lacked a system
of mutual reflection.
He realized suddenly that it was one thing to see the past occupying the
present, but the true test of prescience was to see the past in the future.
Things persisted in not being what they seemed.
"Drink it," Chani said. She waved the hornspout of a watersack under his
nose.
Paul straightened, staring at Chani. He felt carnival excitement in the air.
He knew what would happen if he drank this spice drug with its quintessence of
the substance that brought the change onto him. He would return to the vision of
pure time, of time-become-space. It would perch him on the dizzying summit and
defy him to understand.
From behind Chani, Stilgar said: "Drink it, lad. You delay the rite."
Paul listened to the crowd then, hearing the wildness in their voices-"Lisan al-Gaib," they said. "Muad'Dib!" He looked down at his mother. She
appeared peacefully asleep in a sitting position--her breathing even and deep. A
phrase out of the future that was his lonely past came into his mind: "She
sleeps in the Waters of Life."
Chani tugged at his sleeve.
Paul took the hornspout into his mouth, hearing the people shout. He felt
the liquid gush into his throat as Chani pressed the sack, sensed giddiness in
the fumes. Chani removed the spout, handed the sack into hands that reached for
it from the floor of the cavern. His eyes focused on her arm, the green band of
mourning there.
As she straightened, Chani saw the direction of his gaze, said: "I can mourn
him even in the happiness of the waters. This was something he gave us." She put
her hand into his, pulling him along the ledge. "We are alike in a thing, Usul:
We have each lost a father to the Harkonnens."
Paul followed her. He felt that his head had been separated from his body
and restored with odd connections. His legs were remote and rubbery.
They entered a narrow side passage, its walls dimly lighted by spaced-out
glowglobes. Paul felt the drug beginning to have its unique effect on him,
opening time like a flower. He found need to steady himself against Chani as
they turned through another shadowed tunnel. The mixture of whipcord and
softness he felt beneath her robe stirred his blood. The sensation mingled with
the work of the drug, folding future and past into the present, leaving him the
thinnest margin of trinocular focus.
"I know you, Chani," he whispered. "We've sat upon a ledge above the sand
while I soothed your fears. We've caressed in the dark of the sietch. We've . .
. " He found himself losing focus, tried to shake his head, stumbled.
Chani steadied him, led him through thick hangings into the yellow warmth of
a private apartment--tow tables, cushions, a sleeping pad beneath an orange
spread.
Paul grew aware that they had stopped, that Chani stood facing him, and that
her eyes betrayed a look of quiet terror.
"You must tell me," she whispered.
"You are Sihaya," he said, "the desert spring."
"When the tribe shares the Water," she said, "we're together--all of us. We
. . . share. I can . . . sense the others with me, but I'm afraid to share with
you."
"Why?"
He tried to focus on her, but past and future were merging into the present,
blurring her image. He saw her in countless ways and positions and settings.
"There's something frightening in you," she said. "When I took you away from
the others . . . I did it because I could feel what the others wanted. You . . .
press on people. You . . . make us see things!"
He forced himself to speak distinctly: "What do you see?"
She looked down at her hands. "I see a child . . . in my arms. It's our
child, yours and mine." She put a hand to her mouth. "How can I know every
feature of you?"
They've a little of the talent, his mind told him. But they suppress it
because it terrifies.
In a moment of clarity, he saw how Chani was trembling.
"What is it you want to say?" he asked.
"Usul," she whispered, and still she trembled.
"You cannot back into the future," he said.
A profound compassion for her swept through him. He pulled her against him,
stroked her head. "Chani, Chani, don't fear."
"Usul, help me," she cried.
As she spoke, he felt the drug complete its work within him, ripping away
the curtains to let him see the distant gray turmoil of his future.
"You're so quiet," Chani said.
He held himself poised in the awareness, seeing time stretch out in its
weird dimension, delicately balanced yet whirling, narrow yet spread like a net
gathering countless worlds and forces, a tightwire that he must walk, yet a
teeter-totter on which he balanced.
On one side he could see the Imperium, a Harkonnen called Feyd-Rautha who
flashed toward him like a deadly blade, the Sardaukar raging off their planet to
spread pogrom on Arrakis, the Guild conniving and plotting, the Bene Gesserit
with their scheme of selective breeding. They lay massed like a thunderhead on
his horizon, held back by no more than the Fremen and their Muad'Dib, the
sleeping giant Fremen poised for their wild crusade across the universe.
Paul felt himself at the center, at the pivot where the whole structure
turned, walking a thin wire of peace with a measure of happiness, Chani at his
side. He could see it stretching ahead of him, a time of relative quiet in a
hidden sietch, a moment of peace between periods of violence.
"There's no other place for peace," he said.
"Usul, you're crying," Chani murmured. "Usul, my strength, do you give
moisture to the dead? To whose dead?"
"To ones not yet dead," he said.
"Then let them have their time of life," she said.
He sensed through the drug fog how right she was, pulled her against him
with savage pressure. "Sihaya!" he said.
She put a palm against his cheek, "I'm no longer afraid, Usul. Look at me. I
see what you see when you hold me thus."
"What do you see?" he demanded.
"I see us giving love to each other in a time of quiet between storms. It's
what we were meant to do."
The drug had him again and he thought: So many times you've given me comfort
and forgetfulness. He felt anew the hyperillumination with its high-relief
imagery of time, sensed his future becoming memories--the tender indignities of
physical love, the sharing and communion of selves, the softness and the
violence.
"You're the strong one, Chani," he muttered. "Stay with me. "
"Always," she said, and kissed his cheek.

Book Three
THE PROPHET
= = = = = =
No woman, no man, no child ever was deeply intimate with my father. The closest
anyone ever came to casual camaraderie with the Padishah Emperor was the
relationship offered by Count Hasimir Fenring, a companion from childhood. The
measure of Count Fenring's friendship may be seen first in a positive thing: he
allayed the Landsraad's suspicions after the Arrakis Affair. It cost more than a
billion solaris in spice bribes, so my mother said, and there were other gifts
as well: slave women, royal honors, and tokens of rank. The second major
evidence of the Count's friendship was negative. He refused to kill a man even
though it was within his capabilities and my father commanded it. I will relate
this presently.
-"Count Fenring: A Profile" by the Princess Irulan
The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen raged down the corridor from his private
apartments, flitting through patches of late afternoon sunlight that poured down
from high windows. He bobbed and twisted in his suspensors with violent
movements.
Past the private kitchen he stormed -- past the library, past the small
reception room and into the servants' antechamber where the evening relaxation
already had set in.
The guard captain, Iakin Nefud, squatted on a divan across the chamber, the
stupor of semuta dullness in his flat face, the eerie wailing of semuta music
around him. His own court sat near to do his bidding.
"Nefud!" the Baron roared.
Men scrambled.
Nefud stood, his face composed by the narcotic but with an overlay of
paleness that told of his fear. The semuta music had stopped.
"My Lord Baron," Nefud said. Only the drug kept the trembling out of his
voice.

The Baron scanned the faces around him, seeing the looks of frantic quiet in
them. He returned his attention to Nefud, and spoke in a silken tone:
"How long have you been my guard captain, Nefud?"
Nefud swallowed. "Since Arrakis, my Lord. Almost two years."
"And have you always anticipated dangers to my person?"
"Such has been my only desire, my Lord."
"Then where is Feyd-Rautha?" the Baron roared.
Nefud recoiled. "M'Lord?"
"You do not consider Feyd-Rautha a danger to my person?" Again, the voice
was silken.
Nefud wet his lips with his tongue. Some of the semuta dullness left his
eyes. "Feyd-Rautha's in the slave quarters, my Lord."
"With the women again, eh?" The Baron trembled with the effort of
suppressing anger.
"Sire, it could be he's --"
"Silence!"
The Baron advanced another step into the antechamber, noting how the men
moved back, clearing a subtle space around Nefud, dissociating themselves from
the object of wrath.
"Did I not command you to know precisely where the na-Baron was at all
times?" the Baron asked. He moved a step closer. "Did I not say to you that you
were to know precisely what the na-Baron was saying at all times -- and to
whom?" Another step. "Did I not say to you that you were to tell me whenever he
went into the quarters of the slave women?"
Nefud swallowed. Perspiration stood out on his forehead.
The Baron held his voice flat, almost devoid of emphasis: "Did I not say
these things to you?"
Nefud nodded.
"And did I not say to that you were to check all slave boys sent to me and
that you were to do this yourself . . . personally?"
Again, Nefud nodded.
"Did you, perchance, not see the blemish on the thigh of the one sent me
this evening?" the Baron asked. "Is it possible you --"
"Uncle."
The Baron whirled, stared at Feyd-Rautha standing in the doorway. The
presence of his nephew here, now -- the look of hurry that the young man could
not quite conceal -- all revealed much. Feyd-Rautha had his own spy system
focused on the Baron.
"There is a body in my chambers that I wish removed," the Baron said, and he
kept his hand at the projectile weapon beneath his robes, thankful that his
shield was the best.
Feyd-Rautha glanced at two guardsmen against the right wall, nodded. The two
detached themselves, scurried out the door and down the hall toward the Baron's
apartments.
Those two, eh? the Baron thought. Ah, this young monster has much to learn
yet about conspiracy!
"I presume you left matters peaceful in the slave quarters, Feyd," the Baron
said.
"I've been playing cheops with the slavemaster," Feyd-Rautha said, and he
thought: What has gone wrong? The boy we sent to my uncle has obviously been
killed. But he was perfect for the job. Even Hawat couldn't have made a better
choice. The boy was perfect!
"Playing pyramid chess," the Baron said. "How nice. Did you win?"
"I . . . ah, yes, Uncle." And Feyd-Rautha strove to contain his disquiet.
The Baron snapped his fingers. "Nefud, you wish to be restored to my good
graces?"
"Sire, what have I done?" Nefud quavered.

"That's unimportant now," the Baron said. "Feyd has beaten the slavemaster
at cheops. Did you hear that?"
"Yes . . . Sire."
"I wish you to take three men and go to the slavemaster," the Baron said.
"Garrote the slavemaster. Bring his body to me when you've finished that I may
see it was done properly. We cannot have such inept chess players in our
employ."
Feyd-Rautha went pale, took a step forward. "But, Uncle, I --"
"Later, Feyd," the Baron said, and waved a hand. "Later."
The two guards who had gone to the Baron's quarters for the slave boy's body
staggered past the antechamber door with their load sagging between them, arms
trailing. The Baron watched until they were out of sight.
Nefud stepped up beside the Baron. "You wish me to kill the slavemaster,
now, my Lord?"
"Now," the Baron said. "And when you've finished, add those two who just
passed to your list. I don't like the way they carried that body. One should do
such things neatly. I'll wish to see their carcasses, too."
Nefud said, "My Lord, is it anything that I've --"
"Do as your master has ordered," Feyd-Rautha said. And he thought: All I can
hope for now is to save my own skin.
Good! the Baron thought. He yet knows how to cut his losses. And the Baron
smiled inwardly at himself, thinking: The lad knows, too, what will please me
and be most apt to stay my wrath from falling on him. He knows I must preserve
him. Who else do I have who could take the reins I must leave someday? I have no
other as capable. But he must learn! And I must preserve myself while he's
learning.
Nefud signaled men to assist him, led them out the door.
"Would you accompany me to my chambers, Feyd?" the Baron asked.
"I am yours to command," Feyd-Rautha said. He bowed, thinking: I'm caught.
"After you," the Baron said, and he gestured to the door.
Feyd-Rautha indicated his fear by only the barest hesitation. Have I failed
utterly? he asked himself. Will he slip a poisoned blade into my back . . .
slowly, through the shield? Does he have an alternative successor?
Let him experience this moment of terror, the Baron thought as he walked
along behind his nephew. He will succeed me, but at a time of my choosing. I'll
not have him throwing away what I've built!
Feyd-Rautha tried not to walk too swiftly. He felt the skin crawling on his
back as though his body itself wondered when the blow could come. His muscles
alternately tensed and relaxed.
"Have you heard the latest word from Arrakis?" the Baron asked.
"No, Uncle."
Feyd-Rautha forced himself not to look back. He turned down the hall out of
the servants' wing.
"They've a new prophet or religious leader of some kind among the Fremen,"
the Baron said. "They call him Muad'Dib. Very funny, really. It means 'the
Mouse.' I've told Rabban to let them have their religion. It'll keep them
occupied."
"That's very interesting, Uncle," Feyd-Rautha said. He turned into the
private corridor to his uncle's quarters, wondering: Why does he talk about
religion? Is it some subtle hint to me?
"Yes, isn't it?" the Baron said.
They came into the Baron's apartments through the reception salon to the
bedchamber. Subtle signs of a struggle greeted them here -- a suspensor lamp
displaced, a bedcushion on the floor, a soother-reel spilled open across a
bedstand.

"It was a clever plan," the Baron said. He kept his body shield tuned to
maximum, stopped, facing his nephew. "But not clever enough. Tell me, Feyd, why
didn't you strike me down yourself? You've had opportunity enough."
Feyd-Rautha found a suspensor chair, accomplished a mental shrug as he sat
down in it without being asked.
I must be bold now, he thought.
"You taught me that my own hands must remain clean," he said.
"Ah, yes," the Baron said. "When you face the Emperor, you must be able to
say truthfully that you did not do the deed. The witch at the Emperor's elbow
will hear your words and know their truth or falsehood. Yes. I warned you about
that."
"Why haven't you ever bought a Bene Gesserit, Uncle?" Feyd-Rautha asked.
"With a Truthsayer at your side --"
"You know my tastes!" the Baron snapped.
Feyd-Rautha studied his uncle, said: "Still, one would be valuable for --"
"I trust them not!" the Baron snarled. "And stop trying to change the
subject!"
Feyd-Rautha spoke mildly; "As you wish, Uncle."
"I remember a time in the arena several years ago," the Baron said. "It
seemed there that day a slave had been set to kill you. Is that truly how it
was?"
"It's been so long ago, Uncle. After all, I --"
"No evasions, please," the Baron said, and the tightness of his voice
exposed the rein on his anger.
Feyd-Rautha looked at his uncle, thinking: He knows, else he wouldn't ask.
"It was a sham, Uncle. I arranged it to discredit your slavemaster."
"Very clever," the Baron said. "Brave, too. That slave-gladiator almost took
you, didn't he?"
"Yes."
"If you had finesse and subtlety to match such courage, you'd be truly
formidable." The Baron shook his head from side to side. And as he had done many
times since that terrible day on Arrakis, he found himself regretting the loss
of Piter, the Mentat. There'd been a man of delicate, devilish subtlety. It
hadn't saved him, though. Again, the Baron shook his head. Fate was sometimes
inscrutable.
Feyd-Rautha glanced around the bedchamber, studying the signs of the
struggle, wondering how his uncle had overcome the slave they'd prepared so
carefully.
"How did I best him?" the Baron asked. "Ah-h-h, now, Feyd -- let me keep
some weapons to preserve me in my old age. It's better we use this time to
strike a bargain."
Feyd-Rautha stared at him. A bargain! He means to keep me as his heir for
certain, then. Else why bargain. One bargains with equals or near equals!
"What bargain, Uncle?" And Feyd-Rautha felt proud that his voice remained
calm and reasonable, betraying none of the elation that filled him.
The Baron, too, noted the control. He nodded. "You're good material, Feyd. I
don't waste good material. You persist, however, in refusing to learn my true
value to you. You are obstinate. You do not see why I should be preserved as
someone of the utmost value to you. This . . . " He gestured at the evidence of
the struggle in the bedchamber. "This was foolishness. I do not reward
foolishness."
Get to the point, you old fool! Feyd-Rautha thought.
"You think of me as an old fool," the Baron said. "I must dissuade you of
that."
"You speak of a bargain."
"Ah, the impatience of youth," the Baron said. "Well, this is the substance
of it, then: You will cease these foolish attempts on my life. And I, when you
are ready for it, will step aside in your favor. I will retire to an advisory
position, leaving you in the seat of power."
"Retire, Uncle?"
"You still think me the fool," the Baron said, "and this but confirms it,
eh? You think I'm begging you! Step cautiously, Feyd. This old fool saw through
the shielded needle you'd planted in that slave boy's thigh. Right where I'd put
my hand on it, eh? The smallest pressure and -- snick! A poison needle in the
old fool's palm! Ah-h-h, Feyd . . . "
The Baron shook his head, thinking: It would've worked, too, if Hawat hadn't
warned me. Well, let the lad believe I saw the plot on my own. In a way, I did.
I was the one who saved Hawat from the wreckage of Arrakis. And this lad needs
greater respect for my prowess.
Feyd-Rautha remained silent, struggling, with himself. Is he being truthful?
Does he really mean to retire? Why not? I'm sure to succeed him one day if I
move carefully. He can't live forever. Perhaps it was foolish to try hurrying
the process.
"You speak of a bargain," Feyd-Rautha said. "What pledge do we give to bind
it?"
"How can we trust each other, eh?" the Baron asked. "Well, Feyd, as for you:
I'm setting Thufir Hawat to watch over you. I trust Hawat's Mentat capabilities
in this. Do you understand me? And as for me, you'll have to take me on faith.
But I can't live forever, can I, Feyd? And perhaps you should begin to suspect
now that there're things I know which you should know."
"I give you my pledge and what do you give me?" Feyd-Rautha asked.
"I let you go on living," the Baron said.
Again, Feyd-Rautha studied his uncle. He sets Hawat over me! What would he
say if I told him Hawat planned the trick with the gladiator that cost him his
slavemaster? He'd likely say I was lying in the attempt to discredit Hawat. No,
the good Thufir is a Mentat and has anticipated this moment.
"Well, what do you say?" the Baron asked.
"What can I say? I accept, of course."
And Feyd-Rautha thought: Hawat! He plays both ends against the middle . . .
is that it? Has he moved to my uncle's camp because I didn't counsel with him
over the slave boy attempt?
"You haven't said anything about my setting Hawat to watch you," the Baron
said.
Feyd-Rautha betrayed anger by a flaring of nostrils. The name of Hawat had
been a danger signal in the Harkonnen family for so many years . . . and now it
had a new meaning: still dangerous.
"Hawat's a dangerous toy," Feyd-Rautha said.
"Toy! Don't be stupid. I know what I have in Hawat and how to control it.
Hawat has deep emotions, Feyd. The man without emotions is the one to fear. But
deep emotions . . . ah, now, those can be bent to your needs."
"Uncle, I don't understand you."
"Yes, that's plain enough."
Only a flicker of eyelids betrayed the passage of resentment through FeydRautha.
"And you do not understand Hawat," the Baron said.
Nor do you! Feyd-Rautha thought.
"Who does Hawat blame for his present circumstances?" the Baron asked. "Me?
Certainly. But he was an Atreides tool and bested me for years until the
Imperium took a hand. That's how he sees it. His hate for me is a casual thing
now. He believes he can best me any time. Believing this, he is bested. For I
direct his attention where I want it -- against the Imperium."
Tensions of a new understanding drew tight lines across Feyd-Rautha's
forehead, thinned his mouth. "Against the Emperor?"
Let my dear nephew try the taste of that, the Baron thought. Let him say to
himself: "The Emperor Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen!" Let him ask himself how much
that's worth. Surely it must be worth the life of one old uncle who could make
that dream come to pass!
Slowly, Feyd-Rautha wet his lips with his tongue. Could it be true what the
old fool was saying? There was more here than there seemed to be.
"And what has Hawat to do with this?" Feyd-Rautha asked.
"He thinks he uses us to wreak his revenge upon the Emperor."
"And when that's accomplished?"
"He does not think beyond his revenge. Hawat's a man who must serve others,
and doesn't even know this about himself."
"I've learned much from Hawat," Feyd-Rautha agreed, and felt the truth of
the words as he spoke them. "But the more I learn, the more I feel we should
dispose of him . . . and soon."
"You don't like the idea of his watching you?"
"Hawat watches everybody."
"And he may put you on a throne. Hawat is subtle. He is dangerous, devious.
But I'll not yet withhold the antidote from him. A sword is dangerous, too,
Feyd. We have the scabbard for this one, though. The poison's in him. When we
withdraw the antidote, death will sheathe him."
"In a way, it's like the arena," Feyd-Rautha said. "Feints within feints
within feints. You watch to see which way the gladiator leans, which way he
looks, how he holds his knife."
He nodded to himself, seeing that these words pleased his uncle, but
thinking: Yes! Like the arena! And the cutting edge is the mind!
"Now you see how you need me," the Baron said. "I'm yet of use, Feyd."
A sword to be wielded until he's too blunt for use, Feyd-Rautha thought.
"Yes, Uncle, "he said.
"And now," the Baron said, "we will go down to the slave quarters, we two.
And I will watch while you, with your own hands, kill all the women in the
pleasure wing."
"Uncle!"
"There will be other women, Feyd. But I have said that you do not make a
mistake casually with me."
Feyd-Rautha's face darkened. "Uncle, you --"
"You will accept your punishment and learn something from it," the Baron
said.
Feyd-Rautha met the gloating stare in his uncle's eyes. And I must remember
this night, he thought. And remembering it, I must remember other nights.
"You will not refuse," the Baron said.
What could you do if I refused, old man? Feyd-Rautha asked himself. But he
knew there might be some other punishment, perhaps a more subtle one, a more
brutal lever to bend him.
"I know you, Feyd," the Baron said. "You will not refuse."
All right, Feyd-Rautha thought. I need you now. I see that. The bargain's
made. But I'll not always need you. And . . . someday . . .

-from "The Sayings of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
I've sat across from many rulers of Great Houses, but never seen a more
gross and dangerous pig than this one, Thufir Hawat told himself.
"You may speak plainly with me, Hawat," the Baron rumbled. He leaned back in
his suspensor chair, the eyes in their folds of fat boring into Hawat.

The old Mentat looked down at the table between him and the Baron Vladimir
Harkonnen, noting the opulence of its grain. Even this was a factor to consider
in assessing the Baron, as were the red walls of this private conference room
and the faint sweet herb scent that hung on the air, masking a deeper musk.
"You didn't have me send that warning to Rabban as an idle whim," the Baron
said.
Hawat's leathery old face remained impassive, betraying none of the loathing
he felt. "I suspect many things, my Lord," he said.
"Yes. Well, I wish to know how Arrakis figures in your suspicions about
Salusa Secundus. It is not enough that you say to me the Emperor is in a ferment
about some association between Arrakis and his mysterious prison planet. Now, I
rushed the warning out to Rabban only because the courier had to leave on that
Heighliner. You said there could be no delay. Well and good. But now I will have
an explanation."
He babbles too much, Hawat thought. He's not like Leto who could tell me a
thing with the lift of an eyebrow or the wave of a hand. Nor like the Old Duke
who could express an entire sentence in the way he accented a single word. This
is a clod! Destroying him will be a service to mankind.
"You will not leave here until I've had a full and complete explanation,"
the Baron said.
"You speak too casually of Salusa Secundus," Hawat said.
"It's a penal colony," the Baron said. "The worst riff-raff in the galaxy
are sent to Salusa Secundus. What else do we need to know?"
"That conditions on the prison planet are more oppressive than anywhere
else," Hawat said. "You hear that the mortality rate among new prisoners is
higher than sixty per cent. You hear that the Emperor practices every form of
oppression there. You hear all this and do not ask questions?"
"The Emperor doesn't permit the Great Houses to inspect his prison," the
Baron growled. "But he hasn't seen into my dungeons, either."
"And curiosity about Salusa Secundus is . . . ah . . . " Hawat put a bony
finger to his lips. ". . . discouraged."
"So he's not proud of some of the things he must do there!"
Hawat allowed the faintest of smiles to touch his dark lips. His eyes
glinted in the glowtube light as he stared at the Baron. "And you've never
wondered where the Emperor gets his Sardaukar?"
The Baron pursed his fat lips. This gave his features the look of a pouting
baby, and his voice carried a tone of petulance as he said: "Why . . . he
recruits . . . that is to say, there are the levies and he enlists from --"
"Faaa!" Hawat snapped. "The stories you hear about the exploits of the
Sardaukar, they're not rumors, are they? Those are first-hand accounts from the
limited number of survivors who've fought against the Sardaukar, eh?"
"The Sardaukar are excellent fighting men, no doubt of it," the Baron said.
"But I think my own legions --"
"A pack of holiday excursionists by comparison!" Hawat snarled. "You think I
don't know why the Emperor turned against House Atreides?"
"This is not a realm open to your speculation," the Baron warned.
Is it possible that even he doesn't know what motivated the Emperor in this?
Hawat asked himself.
"Any area is open to my speculation if it does what you've hired me to do,"
Hawat said. "I am a Mentat. You do not withhold information or computation lines
from a Mentat."
For a long minute, the Baron stared at him, then: "Say what you must say.
Mentat."
"The Padishah Emperor turned against House Atreides because the Duke's
Warmasters Gurney Halleck and Duncan Idaho had trained a fighting force -- a
small fighting force -- to within a hair as good as the Sardaukar. Some of them
were even better. And the Duke was in a position to enlarge his force, to make
it every bit as strong as the Emperor's."
The Baron weighed this disclosure, then: "What has Arrakis to do with this?"
"It provides a pool of recruits already conditioned to the bitterest
survival training."
The Baron shook his head. "You cannot mean the Fremen?"
"I mean the Fremen."
"Hah! Then why warn Rabban? There cannot be more than a handful of Fremen
left after the Sardaukar pogrom and Rabban's oppression."
Hawat continued to stare at him silently.
"Not more than a handful!" the baron repeated. "Rabban killed six thousand
of them last year alone!"
Still, Hawat stared at him.
"And the year before it was nine thousand," the baron said. "And before they
left, the Sardaukar must've accounted for at least twenty thousand."
"What are Rabban's troop losses for the past two years?" Hawat asked.
The Baron rubbed his jowls. "Well, he has been recruiting rather heavily, to
be sure. His agents make rather extravagant promises and --"
"Shall we say thirty thousand in round numbers?" Hawat asked.
"That would seem a little high," the baron said.
"Quite the contrary," Hawat said. "I can read between the lines of Rabban's
reports as well as you can. And you certainly must've understood my reports from
our agents."
"Arrakis is a fierce planet," the Baron said. "Storm losses can --"
"We both know the figure for storm accretion," Hawat said.
"What if he has lost thirty thousand?" the Baron demanded, and blood
darkened his face.
"By your own count," Hawat said, "he killed fifteen thousand over two years
while losing twice that number. You say the Sardaukar accounted for another
twenty thousand, possibly a few more. And I've seen the transportation manifests
for their return from Arrakis. If they killed twenty thousand, they lost almost
five for one. Why won't you face these figures, Baron, and understand what they
mean?"
The Baron spoke in a coldly measured cadence: "This is your job, Mentat.
What do they mean?"
"I gave you Duncan Idaho's head count on the sietch he visited," Hawat said.
"It all fits. If they had just two hundred and fifty such sietch communities,
their population would be about five million. My best estimate is that they had
at least twice that many communities. You scatter your population on such a
planet."
"Ten million?" The Baron's jowls quivered with amazement.
"At least."
The Baron pursed his fat lips. The beady eyes stared without wavering at
Hawat. Is this true Mentat computation? he wondered. How could this be and no
one suspect?
"We haven't even cut heavily into their birth-rate-growth figure," Hawat
said. "We've just weeded out some of their less successful specimens, leaving
the strong to grow stronger -- just like on Salusa Secundus."
"Salusa Secundus!" the Baron barked. "What has this to do with the Emperor's
prison planet?"
"A man who survives Salusa Secundus starts out being tougher than most
others," Hawat said. "When you add the very best of military training --"
"Nonsense! By your argument, I could recruit from among the Fremen after the
way they've been oppressed by my nephew."
Hawat spoke in a mild voice: "Don't you oppress any of your troops?"
"Well . . . I . . . but --"
"Oppression is a relative thing," Hawat said. "Your fighting men are much
better off than those around them, heh? They see unpleasant alternative to being
soldiers of the Baron, heh?"
The Baron fell silent, eyes unfocused. The possibilities -- had Rabban
unwittingly given House Harkonnen its ultimate weapon?
Presently he said: "How could you be sure of the loyalty of such recruits?"
"I would take them in small groups, not larger than platoon strength," Hawat
said. "I'd remove them from their oppressive situation and isolate them with a
training cadre of people who understood their background, preferably people who
had preceded them from the same oppressive situation. Then I'd fill them with
the mystique that their planet had really been a secret training ground to
produce just such superior beings as themselves. And all the while, I'd show
them what such superior beings could earn: rich living, beautiful women, fine
mansions . . . whatever they desired."
The Baron began to nod. "The way the Sardaukar live at home."
"The recruits come to believe in time that such a place as Salusa Secundus
is justified because it produced them -- the elite. The commonest Sardaukar
trooper lives a life, in many respects, as exalted as that of any member of a
Great House."
"Such an idea!" the Baron whispered.
"You begin to share my suspicions," Hawat said.
"Where did such a thing start?" the Baron asked.
"Ah, yes: Where did House Corrino originate? Were there people on Salusa
Secundus before the Emperor sent his first contingents of prisoners there? Even
the Duke Leto, a cousin on the distaff side, never knew for sure. Such questions
are not encouraged."
The Baron's eyes glazed with thought. "Yes, a very carefully kept secret.
They'd use every device of --"
"Besides, what's there to conceal?" Hawat asked. "That the Padishah Emperor
has a prison planet? Everyone knows this. That he has --"
"Count Fenring!" the Baron blurted.
Hawat broke off, studied the Baron with a puzzled frown. "What of Count
Fenring?"
"At my nephew's birthday several years ago," the Baron said. "This Imperial
popinjay. Count Fenring, came as official observer and to . . . ah, conclude a
business arrangement between the Emperor and myself."
"So?"
"I . . . ah, during one of our conversations, I believe I said something
about making a prison planet of Arrakis. Fenring --"
"What did you say exactly?" Hawat asked.
"Exactly? That was quite a while ago and --"
"My Lord Baron, if you wish to make the best use of my services, you must
give me adequate information. Wasn't this conversation recorded?"
The Baron's face darkened with anger. "You're as bad as Piter! I don't like
these --"
"Piter is no longer with you my Lord," Hawat said. "As to that, whatever did
happen to Piter?"
"He became too familiar, too demanding of me," the Baron said.
"You assure me you don't waste a useful man," Hawat said. "Will you waste me
by threats and quibbling? We were discussing what you said to Count Fenring."
Slowly, the Baron composed his features. When the time comes, he thought,
I'll remember his manner with me. Yes. I will remember.
"One moment," the Baron said, and he thought back to the meeting in his
great hall. It helped to visualize the cone of silence in which they had stood.
"I said something like this," the Baron said. "The Emperor knows a certain
amount of killing has always been an arm of business.' I was referring to our
work force losses. Then I said something about considering another solution to
the Arrakeen problem and I said the Emperor's prison planet inspired me to
emulate him."
"Witch blood!" Hawat snapped. "What did Fenring say?"
"That's when he began questioning me about you."
Hawat sat back, closed his eyes in thought. "So that's why they started
looking into Arrakis," he said. "Well, the thing's done." He opened his eyes.
"They must have spies all over Arrakis by now. Two years!"
"But certainly my innocent suggestion that --"
"Nothing is innocent in an Emperor's eyes! What were your instructions to
Rabban?"
"Merely that he should teach Arrakis to fear us."
Hawat shook his head. "You now have two alternatives, Baron. You can kill
off the natives, wipe them out entirely, or --"
"Waste an entire work force?"
"Would you prefer to have the Emperor and those Great Houses he can still
swing behind him come in here and perform a curettement, scrape out Giedi Prime
like a hollow gourd?"
The Baron studied his Mentat, then: "He wouldn't dare!"
"Wouldn't he?"
The Baron's lips quivered. "What is your alternative?"
"Abandon your dear nephew, Rabban."
"Aband . . . " The Baron broke off, stared at Hawat.
"Send him no more troops, no aid of any kind. Don't answer his messages
other than to say you've heard of the terrible way he's handled things on
Arrakis and you intend to take corrective measures as soon as you're able. I'll
arrange to have some of your messages intercepted by Imperial spies."
"But what of the spice, the revenues, the --"
"Demand your baronial profits, but be careful how you make your demands.
Require fixed sums of Rabban. We can --"
The Baron turned his hands palms up. "But how can I be certain that my
weasel nephew isn't --"
"We still have our spies on Arrakis. Tell Rabban he either meets the spice
quotas you set him or he'll be replaced."
"I know my nephew," the Baron said. "This would only make him oppress the
population even more."
"Of course he will!" Hawat snapped. "You don't want that stopped now! You
merely want your own hands clean. Let Rabban make your Salusa Secundus for you.
There's no need even to send him any prisoners. He has all the population
required. If Rabban is driving his people to meet your spice quotas, then the
Emperor need suspect no other motive. That's reason enough for putting the
planet on the rack. And you, Baron, will not show by word or action that there's
any other reason for this."
The Baron could not keep the sly tone of admiration out of his voice. "Ah,
Hawat, you are a devious one. Now, how do we move into Arrakis and make use of
what Rabban prepares?"
"That's the simplest thing of all, Baron. If you set each year's quota a bit
higher than the one before, matters will soon reach a head there. Production
will drop off. You can remove Rabban and take over yourself . . . to correct the
mess."
"It fits," the Baron said. "But I can feel myself tiring of all this. I'm
preparing another to take over Arrakis for me."
Hawat studied the fat round face across from him. Slowly the old soldier-spy
began to nod his head. "Feyd-Rautha," he said. "So that's the reason for the
oppression now. You're very devious yourself, Baron. Perhaps we can incorporate
these two schemes. Yes. Your Feyd-Rautha can go to Arrakis as their savior. He
can win the populace. Yes."
The Baron smiled. And behind his smile, he asked himself: Now, how does this
fit in with Hawat's personal scheming?
And Hawat, seeing that he was dismissed, arose and left the red-walled room.
As he walked, he could not put down the disturbing unknowns that cropped into
every computation about Arrakis. This new religious leader that Gurney Halleck
hinted at from his hiding place among the smugglers, this Muad'Dib.
Perhaps I should not have told the Baron to let this religion flourish where
it will, even among the folk of pan and graben, he told himself. But it's well
known that repression makes a religion flourish.
And he thought about Halleck's reports on Fremen battle tactics. The tactics
smacked of Halleck himself . . . and Idaho . . . and even of Hawat.
Did Idaho survive? he asked himself.
But this was a futile question. He did not yet ask himself if it was
possible that Paul had survived. He knew the Baron was convinced that all
Atreides were dead. The Bene Gesserit witch had been his weapon, the Baron
admitted. And that could only mean an end to all -- even to the woman's own son.
What a poisonous hate she must've had for the Atreides, he thought.
Something like the hate I hold for this Baron. Will my blow be as final and
complete as hers?

There is in all things a pattern that is part of our universe. It has symmetry,
elegance, and grace -- those qualities you find always in that which the true
artist captures. You can find it in the turning of the seasons, in the way sand
trails along a ridge, in the branch clusters of the creosote bush or the pattern
of its leaves. We try to copy these patterns in our lives and our society,
seeking the rhythms, the dances, the forms that comfort. Yet, it is possible to
see peril in the finding of ultimate perfection. It is clear that the ultimate
pattern contains its own fixity. In such perfection, all things move toward
death.
-from "The Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
Paul-Muad'Dib remembered that there had been a meal heavy with spice
essence. He clung to this memory because it was an anchor point and he could
tell himself from this vantage that his immediate experience must be a dream.
I am a theater of processes, he told himself. I am a prey to the imperfect
vision, to the race consciousness and its terrible purpose.
Yet, he could not escape the fear that he had somehow overrun himself, lost
his position in time, so that past and future and present mingled without
distinction. It was a kind of visual fatigue and it came, he knew, from the
constant necessity of holding the prescient future as a kind of memory that was
in itself a thing intrinsically of the past.
Chani prepared the meal for me, he told himself.
Yet Chani was deep in the south -- in the cold country where the sun was hot
-- secreted in one of the new sietch strongholds, safe with their son, Leto II.
Or, was that a thing yet to happen?
No, he reassured himself, for Alia-the-Strange-One, his sister, had gone
there with his mother and with Chani -- a twenty-thumper trip into the south,
riding a Reverend Mother's palanquin fixed to the back of a wild maker.
He shied away from thought of riding the giant worms, asking himself: Or is
Alia yet to be born?
I was on razzia, Paul recalled. We went raiding to recover the water of our
dead in Arrakeen. And I found the remains of my father in the funeral pyre. I
enshrined the skull of my father in a Fremen rock mound overlooking Harg Pass.
Or was that a thing yet to be?

My wounds are real, Paul told himself. My scars are real. The shrine of my
father's skull is real.
Still in the dreamlike state, Paul remembered that Harah, Jamis' wife, had
intruded on him once to say there'd been a fight in the sietch corridor. That
had been the interim sietch before the women and children had been sent into the
deep south. Harah had stood there in the entrance to the inner chamber, the
black wings of her hair tied back by water rings on a chain. She had held aside
the chamber's hangings and told him that Chani had just killed someone.
This happened, Paul told himself. This was real, not born out of its time
and subject to change.
Paul remembered he had rushed out to find Chani standing beneath the yellow
globes of the corridor, clad in a brilliant blue wraparound robe with hood
thrown back, a flush of exertion on her elfin features. She had been sheathing
her crysknife. A huddled group had been hurrying away down the corridor with a
burden.
And Paul remembered telling himself: You always know when they're carrying a
body.
Chani's water rings, worn openly in sietch on a cord around her neck,
tinkled as she turned toward him.
"Chani, what is this?" he asked.
"I dispatched one who came to challenge you in single combat, Usul."
"You killed him?"
"Yes. But perhaps I should've left him for Harah."
(And Paul recalled how the faces of the people around them had showed
appreciation for these words. Even Harah had laughed.)
"But he came to challenge me!"
"You trained me yourself in the weirding way, Usul."
"Certainly! But you shouldn't --"
"I was born in the desert, Usul. I know how to use a crysknife."
He suppressed his anger, tried to talk reasonably. "This may all be true,
Chani, but --"
"I am no longer a child hunting scorpions in the sietch by the light of a
handglobe, Usul. I do not play games."
Paul glared at her, caught by the odd ferocity beneath her casual attitude.
"He was not worthy, Usul," Chani said. "I'd not disturb your meditations
with the likes of him." She moved closer, looking at him out of the corners of
her eyes, dropping her voice so that only he might hear. "And, beloved, when
it's learned that a challenger may face me and be brought to shameful death by
Muad'Dib's woman, there'll be fewer challengers."
Yes, Paul told himself, that had certainly happened. It was true-past. And
the number of challengers testing the new blade of Muad'Dib did drop
dramatically.
Somewhere, in a world not-of-the-dream, there was a hint of motion, the cry
of a nightbird.
I dream, Paul reassured himself. It's the spice meal.
Still, there was about him a feeling of abandonment. He wondered it if might
be possible that his ruh-spirit had slipped over somehow into the world where
the Fremen believed he had his true existence -- into the alam al-mithal, the
world of similitudes, that metaphysical realm where all physical limitations
were removed. And he knew fear at the thought of such a place, because removal
of all limitations meant removal of all points of reference. In the landscape of
a myth he could not orient himself and say: "I am I because I am here."
His mother had said once: "The people are divided, some of them, in how they
think of you."
I must be waking from the dream, Paul told himself. For this had happened -these words from his mother, the Lady Jessica who was now a Reverend Mother of
the Fremen, these words had passed through reality.

Jessica was fearful of the religious relationship between himself and the
Fremen, Paul knew. She didn't like the fact that people of both sietch and
graben referred to Muad'Dib as Him. And she went questioning among the tribes,
sending out her Sayyadina spies, collecting their answers and brooding on them.
She had quoted a Bene Gesserit proverb to him: "When religion and politics
travel in the same cart, the riders believe nothing can stand in their way.
Their movement become headlong -- faster and faster and faster. They put aside
all thought of obstacles and forget that a precipice does not show itself to the
man in a blind rush until it's too late."
Paul recalled that he had sat there in his mother's quarters, in the inner
chamber shrouded by dark hangings with their surfaces covered by woven patterns
out of Fremen mythology. He had sat there, hearing her out, noting the way she
was always observing -- even when her eyes were lowered. Her oval face had new
lines in it at the corners of the mouth, but the hair was still like polished
bronze. The wide-set green eyes, though, hid beneath their over-casting of
spice-imbued blue.
"The Fremen have a simple, practical religion," he said.
"Nothing about religion is simple," she warned.
But Paul, seeing the clouded future that still hung over them, found himself
swayed by anger. He could only say: "Religion unifies our forces. It's our
mystique."
"You deliberately cultivate this air, this bravura," she charged. "You never
cease indoctrinating."
"Thus you yourself taught me," he said.
But she had been full of contentions and arguments that day. It had been the
day of the circumcision ceremony for little Leto. Paul had understood some of
the reasons for her upset. She had never accepted his liaison -- the "marriage
of youth" -- with Chani. But Chani had produced an Atreides son, and Jessica had
found herself unable to reject the child with the mother.
Jessica had stirred finally under his stare, said: "You think me an
unnatural mother."
"Of course not."
"I see the way you watch me when I'm with your sister. You don't understand
about your sister."
"I know why Alia is different," he said. "She was unborn, part of you, when
you changed the Water of Life. She --"
"You know nothing of it!"
And Paul, suddenly unable to express the knowledge gained out of its time,
said only: "I don't think you unnatural."
She saw his distress, said: "There is a thing, Son."
"Yes?"
"I do love your Chani. I accept her."
This was real, Paul told himself. This wasn't the imperfect vision to be
changed by the twistings out of time's own birth.
The reassurance gave him a new hold on his world. Bits of solid reality
began to dip through the dream state into his awareness. He knew suddenly that
he was in a hiereg, a desert camp. Chani had planted their stilltent on floursand for its softness. That could only mean Chani was near by -- Chani, his
soul, Chani his Sihaya, sweet as the desert spring, Chani up from the palmaries
of the deep south.
Now, he remembered her singing a sand chanty to him in the time for sleep.
"O my soul,
Have no taste for Paradise this night,
And I swear by Shai-hulud
You will go there,
Obedient to my love."
And she had sung the walking song lovers shared on the sand, its rhythm like
the drag of the dunes against the feet:
"Tell me of thine eyes
And I will tell thee of
Tell me of thy feet
And I will tell thee of
Tell me of thy sleeping
And I will tell thee of
Tell me of thy desires
And I will tell thee of
thy heart.
thy hands.
thy waking.
thy need."
He had heard someone strumming a baliset in another tent. And he'd thought
then of Gurney Halleck. Reminded by the familiar instrument, he had thought of
Gurney whose face he had seen in a smuggler band, but who had not seen him,
could not see him or know of him lest that inadvertently lead the Harkonnens to
the son of the Duke they had killed.
But the style of the player in the night, the distinctiveness of the fingers
on the baliset's strings, brought the real musician back to Paul's memory. It
had been Chatt the Leaper, captain of the Fedaykin, leader of the death
commandos who guarded Muad'Dib.
We are in the desert, Paul remembered. We are in the central erg beyond the
Harkonnen patrols. I am here to walk the sand, to lure a maker and mount him by
my own cunning that I may be a Fremen entire.
He felt now the maula pistol at his belt, the crysknife. He felt the silence
surrounding him.
It was that special pre-morning silence when the nightbirds had gone and the
day creatures had not yet signaled their alertness to their enemy, the sun.
"You must ride the sand in the light of day that Shai-hulud shall see and
know you have no fear," Stilgar had said. "Thus we turn our time around and set
ourselves to sleep this night."
Quietly, Paul sat up, feeling the looseness of a slacked stillsuit around
his body, the shadowed stilltent beyond. So softly he moved, yet Chani heard
him.
She spoke from the tent's gloom, another shadow there: "It's not yet full
light, beloved."
"Sihaya," he said, speaking with half a laugh in his voice.
"You call me your desert spring," she said, "but this day I'm thy goad. I am
the Sayyadina who watches that the rites be obeyed."
He began tightening his stillsuit. "You told me once the words of the Kitab
al-Ibar," he said. "You told me: 'Woman is thy field; go then to thy field and
till it.' "
"I am the mother of thy firstborn," she agreed.
He saw her in the grayness matching him movement for movement, securing her
stillsuit for the open desert. "You should get all the rest you can," she said.
He recognized her love for him speaking then and chided her gently: "The
Sayyadina of the Watch does not caution or warn the candidate."
She slid across to his side, touched his cheek with her palm. "Today, I am
both the watcher and the woman."
"You should've left this duty to another," he said.
"Waiting is bad enough at best," she said. "I'd sooner be at thy side."
He kissed her palm before securing the faceflap of his suit, then turned and
cracked the seal of the tent. The air that came in to them held the chill notquite-dryness that would precipitate trace dew in the dawn. With it came the
smell of a pre-spice mass, the mass they had detected off to the northeast, and
that told them there would be a maker near by.

Paul crawled through the sphincter opening, stood on the sand and stretched
the sleep from his muscles. A faint green-pearl luminescence etched the eastern
horizon. The tents of his troop were small false dunes around him in the gloom.
He saw movement off to the left -- the guard, and knew they had seen him.
They knew the peril he faced this day. Each Fremen had faced it. They gave
him this last few moments of isolation now that he might prepare himself.
It must be done today, he told himself.
He thought of the power he wielded in the face of the pogrom -- the old men
who sent their sons to him to be trained in the weirding way of battle, the old
men who listened to him now in council and followed his plans, the men who
returned to pay him that highest Fremen compliment: "Your plan worked,
Muad'Dib."
Yet the meanest and smallest of the Fremen warriors could do a thing that he
had never done. And Paul knew his leadership suffered from the omnipresent
knowledge of this difference between them.
He had not ridden the maker.
Oh, he'd gone up with the others for training trips and raids, but he had
not made his own voyage. Until he did, his world was bounded by the abilities of
others. No true Fremen could permit this. Until he did this thing himself, even
the great southlands -- the area some twenty thumpers beyond the erg -- were
denied him unless he ordered a palanquin and rode like a Reverend Mother or one
of the sick and wounded.
Memory returned to him of his wrestling with his inner awareness during the
night. He saw a strange parallel here -- if he mastered the maker, his rule was
strengthened; if he mastered the inward eye, this carried its own measure of
command. But beyond them both lay the clouded area, the Great Unrest where all
the universe seemed embroiled.
The differences in the ways he comprehended the universe haunted him -accuracy matched with inaccuracy. He saw it in situ. Yet, when it was born, when
it came into the pressures of reality, the now had its own life and grew with
its own subtle differences. Terrible purpose remained. Race consciousness
remained. And over all loomed the jihad, bloody and wild.
Chani joined him outside the tent, hugging her elbows, looking up at him
from the corners of her eyes the way she did when she studied his mood.
"Tell me again about the waters of thy birthworld, Usul," she said.
He saw that she was trying to distract him, ease his mind of tensions before
the deadly test. It was growing lighter, and he noted that some of his Fedaykin
were already striking their tents.
"I'd rather you told me about the sietch and about our son," he said. "Does
our Leto yet hold my mother in his palm?"
"It's Alia he holds as well," she said. "And he grows rapidly. He'll be a
big man."
"What's it like in the south?" he asked.
"When you ride the maker you'll see for yourself," she said.
"But I wish to see it first through your eyes."
"It's powerfully lonely," she said.
He touched the nezhoni scarf at her forehead where it protruded from her
stillsuit cap. "Why will you not talk about the sietch?"
"I have talked about it. The sietch is a lonely place without our men. It's
a place of work. We labor in the factories and the potting rooms. There are
weapons to be made, poles to plant that we may forecast the weather, spice to
collect for the bribes. There are dunes to be planted to make them grow and to
anchor them. There are fabrics and rugs to make, fuel cells to charge. There are
children to train that the tribe's strength may never be lost."
"Is nothing then pleasant in the sietch?" he asked.
"The children are pleasant. We observe the rites. We have sufficient food.
Sometimes one of us may come north to be with her man. Life must go on."
"My sister, Alia -- is she accepted yet by the people?"
Chani turned toward him in the growing dawnlight. Her eyes bored into him.
"It's a thing to be discussed another time, beloved."
"Let us discuss it now."
"You should conserve your energies for the test," she said.
He saw that he had touched something sensitive, hearing the withdrawal in
her voice. "The unknown brings its own worries," he said.
Presently she nodded, said, "There is yet . . . misunderstanding because of
Alia's strangeness. The women are fearful because a child little more than an
infant talks . . . of things that only an adult should know. They do not
understand the . . . change in the womb that made Alia . . . different."
"There is trouble?" he asked. And he thought: I've seen visions of trouble
over Alia.
Chani looked toward the growing line of the sunrise. "Some of the women
banded to appeal to the Reverend Mother. They demanded she exorcise the demon in
her daughter. They quoted the scripture: 'Suffer not a witch to live among us.'
"
"And what did my mother say to them?"
"She recited the law and sent the women away abashed. She said: 'If Alia
incites trouble, it is the fault of authority for not foreseeing and preventing
the trouble.' And she tried to explain how the change had worked on Alia in the
womb. But the women were angry because they had been embarrassed. They went away
muttering."
There will be trouble because of Alia, he thought.
A crystal blowing of sand touched the exposed portions of his face, bringing
the scent of the pre-spice mass. "El Sayal, the rain of sand that brings the
morning," he said.
He looked out across the gray light of the desert landscape, the landscape
beyond pity, the sand that was form absorbed in itself. Dry lightning streaked a
dark corner to the south -- sign that a storm had built up its static charge
there. The roll of thunder boomed long after.
"The voice that beautifies the land," Chani said.
More of his men were stirring out of their tents. Guards were coming in from
the rims. Everything around him moved smoothly in the ancient routine that
required no orders.
"Give as few orders as possible," his father had told him . . . once . . .
long ago. "Once you've given orders on a subject, you must always give orders on
that subject."
The Fremen knew this rule instinctively.
The troop's watermaster began the morning chanty, adding to it now the call
for the rite to initiate a sandrider.
"The world is a carcass," the man chanted, his voice wailing across the
dunes. "Who can turn away the Angel of Death? What Shai-hulud has decreed must
be."
Paul listened, recognizing that these were the words that also began the
death chant of his Fedaykin, the words the death commandos recited as they
buried themselves into battle.
Will there be a rock shrine here this day to mark the passing of another
soul? Paul asked himself. Will Fremen stop here in the future, each to add
another stone and think on Muad'Dib who died in this place?
He knew this was among the alternatives today, a fact along lines of the
future radiating from this position in time-space. The imperfect vision plagued
him. The more he resisted his terrible purpose and fought against the coming of
the jihad, the greater the turmoil that wove through his prescience. His entire
future was becoming like a river hurtling toward a chasm -- the violent nexus
beyond which all was fog and clouds.

"Stilgar approaches," Chani said. "I must stand apart now, beloved. Now, I
must be Sayyadina and observe the rite that it may be reported truly in the
Chronicles." She looked up at him and, for a moment, her reserve slipped, then
she had herself under control. "When this is past, I shall prepare thy breakfast
with my own hands," she said. She turned away.
Stilgar moved toward him across the flour sand, stirring up little dust
puddles. The dark niches of his eyes remained steady on Paul with their untamed
stare. The glimpse of black beard above the stillsuit mask, the lines of craggy
cheeks, could have been wind-etched from the native rock for all their movement.
The man carried Paul's banner on its staff -- the green and black banner
with a water tube in the staff -- that already was a legend in the land. Half
pridefully, Paul thought: I cannot do the simplest thing without its becoming a
legend. They will mark how I parted from Chani, how I greet Stilgar -- every
move I make this day. Live or die, it is a legend. I must not die. Then it will
be only legend and nothing to stop the jihad.
Stilgar planted the staff in the sand beside Paul, dropped his hands to his
sides. The blue-within-blue eyes remained level and intent. And Paul thought how
his own eyes already were assuming this mask of color from the spice.
"They denied us the Hajj," Stilgar said with ritual solemnity.
As Chani had taught him, Paul responded: "Who can deny a Fremen the right to
walk or ride where he wills?"
"I am a Naib," Stilgar said, "never to be taken alive. I am a leg of the
death tripod that will destroy our foes."
Silence settled over them.
Paul glanced at the other Fremen scattered over the sand beyond Stilgar, the
way they stood without moving for this moment of personal prayer. And he thought
of how the Fremen were a people whose living consisted of killing, an entire
people who had lived with rage and grief all of their days, never once
considering what might take the place of either -- except for a dream with which
Liet-Kynes had infused them before his death.
"Where is the Lord who led us through the land of desert and of pits?"
Stilgar asked.
"He is ever with us," the Fremen chanted.
Stilgar squared his shoulders, stepped closer to Paul and lowered his voice.
"Now, remember what I told you. Do it simply and directly -- nothing fancy.
Among our people, we ride the maker at the age of twelve. You are more than six
years beyond that age and not born to this life. You don't have to impress
anyone with your courage. We know you are brave. All you must do is call the
maker and ride him."
"I will remember," Paul said.
"See that you do. I'll not have you shame my teaching."
Stilgar pulled a plastic rod about a meter long from beneath his robe. The
thing was pointed at one end, had a spring-wound clapper at the other end. "I
prepared this thumper myself. It's a good one. Take it."
Paul felt the warm smoothness of the plastic as he accepted the thumper.
"Shishakli has your hooks," Stilgar said. "He'll hand them to you as you
step out onto that dune over there." He pointed to his right. "Call a big maker,
Usul. Show us the way."
Paul marked the tone of Stilgar's voice -- half ritual and half that of a
worried friend.
In that instant, the sun seemed to bound above the horizon. The sky took on
the silvered gray-blue that warned this would be a day of extreme heat and
dryness even for Arrakis.
"It is the time of the scalding day," Stilgar said, and now his voice was
entirely ritual. "Go, Usul, and ride the maker, travel the sand as a leader of
men."
Paul saluted his banner, noting how the green and black flag hung limply now
that the dawn wind had died. He turned toward the dune Stilgar had indicated -a dirty tan slope with an S-track crest. Already, most of the troop was moving
out in the opposite direction, climbing the other dune that had sheltered their
camp.
One robed figure remained in Paul's path: Shishakli, a squad leader of the
Fedaykin, only his slope-lidded eyes visible between stillsuit cap and mask.
Shishakli presented two thin, whiplike shafts as Paul approached. The shafts
were about a meter and a half long with glistening plasteel hoods at one end,
roughened at the other end for a firm grip.
Paul accepted them both in his left hand as required by the ritual.
"They are my own hooks," Shishakli said in a husky voice. "They never have
failed."
Paul nodded, maintaining the necessary silence, moved past the man and up
the dune slope. At the crest, he glanced back, saw the troop scattering like a
flight of insects, their robes fluttering. He stood alone now on the sandy ridge
with only the horizon in front of him, the flat and unmoving horizon. This was a
good dune Stilgar had chosen, higher than its companions for the viewpoint
vantage.
Stooping, Paul planted the thumper deep into the windward face where the
sand was compacted and would give maximum transmission to the drumming. Then he
hesitated, reviewing the lessons, reviewing the life-and-death necessities that
faced him.
When he threw the latch, the thumper would begin its summons. Across the
sand, a giant worm -- a maker -- would hear and come to the drumming. With the
whiplike hook-staffs, Paul knew, he could mount the maker's high curving back.
For as long as a forward edge of a worm's ring segment was held open by a hook,
open to admit abrasive sand into the more sensitive interior, the creature would
not retreat beneath the desert. It would, in fact, roll its gigantic body to
bring the opened segment as far away from the desert surface as possible.
I am a sandrider, Paul told himself.
He glanced down at the hooks in his left hand, thinking that he had only to
shift those hooks down the curve of a maker's immense side to make the creature
roll and turn, guiding it where he willed. He had seen it done. He had been
helped up the side of a worm for a short ride in training. The captive worm
could be ridden until it lay exhausted and quiescent upon the desert surface and
a new maker must be summoned.
Once he was past this test, Paul knew, he was qualified to make the twentythumper journey into the southland -- to rest and restore himself -- into the
south where the women and the families had been hidden from the pogrom among the
new palmaries and sietch warrens.
He lifted his head and looked to the south, reminding himself that the maker
summoned wild from the erg was an unknown quantity, and the one who summoned it
was equally unknown to this test.
"You must gauge the approaching maker carefully," Stilgar had explained.
"You must stand close enough that you can mount it as it passes, yet not so
close that it engulfs you."
With abrupt decision, Paul released the thumper's latch. The clapper began
revolving and the summons drummed through the sand, a measured "lump . . . lump
. . . lump . . . "
He straightened, scanning the horizon, remembering Stilgar's words: "Judge
the line of approach carefully. Remember, a worm seldom makes an unseen approach
to a thumper. Listen all the same. You may often hear it before you see it."
And Chani's words of caution, whispered at night when her fear for him
overcame her, filled his mind: "When you take your stand along the maker's path,
you must remain utterly still. You must think like a patch of sand. Hide beneath
your cloak and become a little dune in your very essence."
Slowly, he scanned the horizon, listening, watching for the signs he had
been taught.
It came from the southeast, a distant hissing, a sand-whisper. Presently he
saw the faraway outline of the creature's track against the dawnlight and
realized he had never before seen a maker this large, never heard of one this
size. It appeared to be more than half a league long, and the rise of the
sandwave at its cresting head was like the approach of a mountain.
This is nothing I have seen by vision or in life, Paul cautioned himself. He
hurried across the path of the thing to take his stand, caught up entirely by
the rushing needs of this moment.

Princess Irulan
A thought came unbidden to Jessica's mind: Paul will be undergoing his
sandrider test at any moment now. They try to conceal this fact from me, but
it's obvious.
And Chani has gone on some mysterious errand.
Jessica sat in her resting chamber, catching a moment of quiet between the
night's classes. It was a pleasant chamber, but not as large as the one she had
enjoyed in Sietch Tabr before their flight from the pogrom. Still, this place
had thick rugs on the floor, soft cushions, a low coffee table near at hand,
multicolored hangings on the walls, and soft yellow glowglobes overhead. The
room was permeated with the distinctive acrid furry odor of a Fremen sietch that
she had come to associate with a sense of security.
Yet she knew she would never overcome a feeling of being in an alien place.
It was the harshness that the rugs and hangings attempted to conceal.
A faint tinkling-drumming-slapping penetrated to the resting chamber.
Jessica knew it for a birth celebration, probably Subiay's. Her time was near.
And Jessica knew she'd see the baby soon enough -- a blue-eyed cherub brought to
the Reverend Mother for blessing. She knew also that her daughter, Alia, would
be at the celebration and would report on it.
It was not yet time for the nightly prayer of parting. They wouldn't have
started a birth celebration near the time of ceremony that mourned the slave
raids of Poritrin, Bela Tegeuse, Rossak, and Harmonthep.
Jessica sighed. She knew she was trying to keep her thoughts off her son and
the dangers he faced -- the pit traps with their poisoned barbs, the Harkonnen
raids (although these were growing fewer as the Fremen took their toll of
aircraft and raiders with the new weapons Paul had given them), and the natural
dangers of the desert -- makers and thirst and dust chasms.
She thought of calling for coffee and with the thought came that everpresent awareness of paradox in the Fremen way of life: how well they lived in
these sietch caverns compared to the graben pyons; yet, how much more they
endured in the open hajr of the desert than anything the Harkonnen bondsmen
endured.
A dark hand inserted itself through the hangings beside her, deposited a cup
upon the table and withdrew. From the cup arose the aroma of spiced coffee.
An offering from the birth celebration, Jessica thought.
She took the coffee and sipped it, smiling at herself. In what other society
of our universe, she asked herself, could a person of my station accept an
anonymous drink and quaff that drink without fear? I could alter any poison now
before it did me harm, or course, but the donor doesn't realize this.
She drained the cup, feeling the energy and lift of its contents -- hot and
delicious.
And she wondered what other society would have such a natural regard for her
privacy and comfort that the giver would intrude only enough to deposit the gift
and not inflict her with the donor? Respect and love had sent the gift -- with
only a slight tinge of fear.
Another element of the incident forced itself into her awareness: she had
thought of coffee and it had appeared. There was nothing of telepathy here, she
knew. It was the tau, the oneness of the sietch community, a compensation from
the subtle poison of the spice diet they shared. The great mass of the people
could never hope to attain the enlightenment the spice seed brought to her; they
had not been trained and prepared for it. Their minds rejected what they could
not understand or encompass. Still they felt and reacted sometimes like a single
organism.
And the thought of coincidence never entered their minds.
Has Paul passed his test on the sand? Jessica asked herself. He's capable,
but accident can strike down even the most capable.
The waiting.
It's the dreariness, she thought. You can wait just so long. Then the
dreariness of the waiting overcomes you.
There was all manner of waiting in their lives.
More than two years we've been here, she thought, and twice that number at
least to go before we can even hope to think of trying to wrest Arrakis from the
Harkonnen governor, the Mudir Nahya, the Beast Rabban.
"Reverend Mother?"
The voice from outside the hangings at her door was that of Harah, the other
woman in Paul's menage.
"Yes, Harah."
The hangings parted and Harah seemed to glide through them. She wore sietch
sandals, a red-yellow wraparound that exposed her arms almost to the shoulders.
Her black hair was parted in the middle and swept back like the wings of an
insect, flat and oily against her head. The jutting, predatory features were
drawn into an intense frown.
Behind Harah came Alia, a girl-child of about two years.
Seeing her daughter, Jessica was caught as she frequently was by Alia's
resemblance to Paul at that age -- the same wide-eyed solemnity to her questing
look, the dark hair and firmness of mouth. But there were subtle differences,
too, and it was in these that most adults found Alia disquieting. The child -little more than a toddler -- carried herself with a calmness and awareness
beyond her years. Adults were shocked to find her laughing at a subtle play of
words between the sexes. Or they'd catch themselves listening to her halflisping voice, still blurred as it was by an unformed soft palate, and discover
in her words sly remarks that could only be based on experiences no two-year-old
had ever encountered.
Harah sank to a cushion with an exasperated sigh, frowned at the child.
"Alia." Jessica motioned to her daughter.
The child crossed to a cushion beside her mother, sank to it and clasped her
mother's hand. The contact of flesh restored that mutual awareness they had
shared since before Alia's birth. It wasn't a matter of shared thoughts -although there were bursts of that if they touched while Jessica was changing
the spice poison for a ceremony. It was something larger, an immediate awareness
of another living spark, a sharp and poignant thing, a nerve-sympatico that made
them emotionally one.
In the formal manner that befitted a member of her son's household, Jessica
said: "Subakh ul kuhar, Harah. This night finds you well?"
With the same traditional formality, she said: "Subakh un nar. I am well."
The words were almost toneless. Again, she sighed.
Jessica sensed amusement from Alia.
"My brother's ghanima is annoyed with me," Alia said in her half-lisp.
Jessica marked the term Alia used to refer to Harah -- ghanima. In the
subtleties of the Fremen tongue, the word meant "something acquired in battle"
and with the added overtone that the something no longer was used for its
original purpose. An ornament, a spearhead used as a curtain weight.
Harah scowled at the child. "Don't try to insult me, child. I know my
place."
"What have you done this time, Alia?" Jessica asked.
Harah answered; "Not only has she refused to play with the other children
today, but she intruded where . . . "
"I hid behind the hangings and watched Subiay's child being born," Alia
said. "It's a boy. He cried and cried. What a set of lungs! When he'd cried long
enough --"
"She came out and touched him," Harah said, "and he stopped crying. Everyone
knows a Fremen baby must get his crying done at birth, if he's in sietch because
he can never cry again lest he betray us on hajr."
"He'd cried enough," Alia said. "I just wanted to feel his spark, his life.
That's all. And when he felt me he didn't want to cry anymore."
"It's just made more talk among the people," Harah said.
"Subiay's boy is healthy?" Jessica asked. She saw that something was
troubling Harah deeply and wondered at it.
"Healthy as any mother could ask," Harah said. "They know Alia didn't hurt
him. They didn't so much mind her touching him. He settled down right away and
was happy. It was . . . " Harah shrugged.
"It's the strangeness of my daughter, is that it?" Jessica asked. "It's the
way she speaks of things beyond her years and of things no child her age could
know -- things of the past."
"How could she know what a child looked like on Bela Tegeuse?" Harah
demanded.
"But he does!" Alia said, "Subiay's boy looks just like the son of Mitha
born before the parting."
"Alia!" Jessica said. "I warned you."
"But, Mother, I saw it and it was true and . . . "
Jessica shook her head, seeing the signs of disturbance in Harah's face.
What have I borne? Jessica asked herself. A daughter who knew at birth
everything that I knew . . . and more: everything revealed to her out of the
corridors of the past by the Reverend Mothers within me.
"It's not just the things she says," Harah said. "It's the exercises, too:
the way she sits and stares at a rock, moving only one muscle beside her nose,
or a muscle on the back of a finger, or --"
"Those are the Bene Gesserit training," Jessica said. "You know that, Harah.
Would you deny my daughter her inheritance?"
"Reverend Mother, you know these things don't matter to me," Harah said.
"It's the people and the way they mutter. I feel danger in it. They say your
daughter's a demon, that other children refuse to play with her, that she's --"
"She has so little in common with the other children," Jessica said. "She's
no demon. It's just the --"
"Of course she's not!"
Jessica found herself surprised at the vehemence in Harah's tone, glanced
down at Alia. The child appeared lost in thought, radiating a sense of . . .
waiting. Jessica returned her attention to Harah.
"I respect the fact that you're a member of my son's household," Jessica
said. (Alia stirred against her hand.) "You may speak openly with me of
whatever's troubling you."
"I will not be a member of your son's household much longer," Harah said.
"I've waited this long for the sake of my sons, the special training they
receive as the children of Usul. It's little enough I could give them since it's
known I don't share your son's bed."
Again Alia stirred beside her, half-sleeping, warm.
"You'd have made a good companion for my son, though," Jessica said. And she
added to herself because such thoughts were ever with her: Companion . . . not a
wife. Jessica's thoughts went then straight to the center, to the pang that came
from the common talk in the sietch that her son's companionship with Chani had
become a permanent thing, the marriage.
I love Chani, Jessica thought, but she reminded herself that love might have
to step aside for royal necessity. Royal marriages had other reasons than love.
"You think I don't know what you plan for your son?" Harah asked.
"What do you mean?" Jessica demanded.
"You plan to unite the tribes under Him," Harah said.
"Is that bad?"
"I see danger for him . . . and Alia is part of that danger."
Alia nestled closer to her mother, eyes opened now and studying Harah.
"I've watched you two together," Harah said, "the way you touch. And Alia is
like my own flesh because she's sister to one who is like my brother. I've
watched over her and guarded her from the time she was a mere baby, from the
time of the razzia when we fled here. I've seen many things about her."
Jessica nodded, feeling disquiet begin to grow in Alia beside her.
"You know what I mean," Harah said. "The way she knew from the first what we
were saying to her. When has there been another baby who knew the water
discipline so young? What other baby's first words to her nurse were: 'I love
you, Harah'?"
Harah stared at Alia. "Why do you think I accept her insults? I know there's
no malice in them."
Alia looked up at her mother.
"Yes, I have reasoning powers, Reverend Mother," Harah said. "I could have
been of the Sayyadina. I have seen what I have seen."
"Harah . . . " Jessica shrugged. "I don't know what to say." And she felt
surprise at herself, because this literally was true.
Alia straightened, squared her shoulders. Jessica felt the sense of waiting
ended, an emotion compounded of decision and sadness.
"We made a mistake," Alia said. "Now we need Harah."
"It was the ceremony of the seed," Harah said, "when you changed the Water
of Life, Reverend Mother, when Alia was yet unborn within you."
Need Harah? Jessica asked herself.
"Who else can talk among the people and make them begin to understand me?"
Alia asked.
"What would you have her do?" Jessica asked.
"She already knows what to do," Alia said.
"I will tell them the truth," Harah said. Her face seemed suddenly old and
sad with its olive skin drawn into frown wrinkles, a witchery in the sharp
features. "I will tell them that Alia only pretends to be a little girl, that
she has never been a little girl."
Alia shook her head. Tears ran down her cheeks, and Jessica felt the wave of
sadness from her daughter as though the emotion were her own.
"I know I'm a freak," Alia whispered. The adult summation coming from the
child mouth was like a bitter confirmation.
"You're not a freak!" Harah snapped. "Who dared say you're a freak?"
Again, Jessica marveled at the fierce note of protectiveness in Harah's
voice. Jessica saw then that Alia had judged correctly -- they did need Harah.
The tribe would understand Harah -- both her words and her emotions -- for it
was obvious she loved Alia as though this were her own child.

"Who said it?" Harah repeated.
"Nobody."
Alia used a corner of Jessica's aba to wipe the tears from her face. She
smoothed the robe where she had dampened and crumpled it.
"Then don't you say it," Harah ordered.
"Yes, Harah."
"Now," Harah said, "you may tell me what it was like so that I may tell the
others. Tell me what it is that happened to you."
Alia swallowed, looked up at her mother.
Jessica nodded.
"One day I woke up," Alia said. "It was like waking from sleep except that I
could not remember going to sleep. I was in a warm, dark place. And I was
frightened."
Listening to the half-lisping voice of her daughter, Jessica remembered that
day in the big cavern.
"When I was frightened," Alia said, "I tried to escape, but there was no way
to escape. Then I saw a spark . . . but it wasn't exactly like seeing it. The
spark was just there with me and I felt the spark's emotions . . . soothing me,
comforting me, telling me that way that everything would be all right. That was
my mother."
Harah rubbed at her eyes, smiled reassuringly at Alia. Yet there was a look
of wildness in the eyes of the Fremen woman, an intensity as though they, too,
were trying to hear Alia's words.
And Jessica thought: What do we really know of how such a one thinks . . .
out of her unique experiences and training and ancestry?
"Just when I felt safe and reassured," Alia said, "there, was another spark
with us . . . and everything was happening at once. The other spark was the old
Reverend Mother. She was . . . trading lives with my mother . . . everything . .
. and I was there with them, seeing it all . . . everything. And it was over,
and I was them and all the others and myself . . . only it took me a long time
to find myself again. There were so many others."
"It was a cruel thing," Jessica said. "No being should wake into
consciousness thus. The wonder of it is you could accept all that happened to
you."
"I couldn't do anything else!" Alia said. "I didn't know how to reject or
hide my consciousness . . . or shut if off . . . everything just happened . . .
everything . . . "
"We didn't know," Harah murmured. "When we gave your mother the Water to
change, we didn't know you existed within her."
"Don't be sad about it, Harah," Alia said. "I shouldn't feel sorry for
myself. After all, there's cause for happiness here: I'm a Reverend Mother. The
tribe has two Rev . . . "
She broke off, tipping her head to listen.
Harah rocked back on her heels against the sitting cushion, stared at Alia,
bringing her attention then up to Jessica's face.
"Didn't you suspect?" Jessica asked.
"Sh-h-h-h," Alia said.
A distant rhythmic chanting came to them through the hangings that separated
them from the sietch corridors. It grew louder, carrying distinct sounds now:
"Ya! Ya! Yawm! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, wallah! Ya! Ya! Yawm! Mu zein, Wallah!"
The chanters passed the outer entrance, and their voices boomed through to
the inner apartments. Slowly the sound receded.
When the sound had dimmed sufficiently, Jessica began the ritual, the
sadness in her voice: "It was Ramadhan and April on Bela Tegeuse."
"My family sat in their pool courtyard," Harah said, "in air bathed by the
moisture that arose from the spray of a fountain. There was a tree of portyguls,
round and deep in color, near at hand. There was a basket with mish mish and
baklawa and mugs of liban -- all manner of good things to eat. In our gardens
and, in our flocks, there was peace . . . peace in all the land."
"Life was full with happiness until the raiders came," Alia said.
"Blood ran cold at the scream of friends," Jessica said. And she felt the
memories rushing through her out of all those other pasts she shared.
"La, la, la, the women cried," said Harah.
"The raiders came through the mushtamal, rushing at us with their knives
dripping red from the lives of our men," Jessica said.
Silence came over the three of them as it was in all the apartments of the
sietch, the silence while they remembered and kept their grief thus fresh.
Presently, Harah uttered the ritual ending to the ceremony, giving the words
a harshness that Jessica had never before heard in them.
"We will never forgive and we will never forget," Harah said.
In the thoughtful quiet that followed her words, they heard a muttering of
people, the swish of many robes. Jessica sensed someone standing beyond the
hangings that shielded her chamber.
"Reverend Mother?"
A woman's voice, and Jessica recognized it: the voice of Tharthar, one of
Stilgar's wives.
"What is it, Tharthar?"
"There is trouble, Reverend Mother."
Jessica felt a constriction at her heart, an abrupt fear for Paul. "Paul . .
." she gasped.
Tharthar spread the hangings, stepped into the chamber. Jessica glimpsed a
press of people in the outer room before the hangings fell. She looked up at
Tharthar -- a small, dark woman in a red-figured robe of black, the total blue
of her eyes trained fixedly on Jessica, the nostrils of her tiny nose dilated to
reveal the plug scars.
"What is it?" Jessica demanded.
"There is word from the sand," Tharthar said. "Usul meets the maker for his
test . . . it is today. The young men say he cannot fail, he will be a sandrider
by nightfall. The young men are banding for a razzia. They will raid in the
north and meet Usul there. They say they will raise the cry then. They say they
will force him to call out Stilgar and assume command of the tribes."
Gathering water, planting the dunes, changing their world slowly but surely
-- these are no longer enough, Jessica thought. The little raids, the certain
raids -- these are no longer enough now that Paul and I have trained them. They
feel their power. They want to fight.
Tharthar shifted from one foot to the other, cleared her throat.
We know the need for cautious waiting, Jessica thought, but there's the core
of our frustration. We know also the harm that waiting extended too long can do
us. We lose our senses of purpose if the waiting's prolonged.
"The young men say if Usul does not call out Stilgar, then he must be
afraid," Tharthar said.
She lowered her gaze.
"So that's the way of it," Jessica muttered. And she thought: Well I saw it
coming. As did Stilgar.
Again, Tharthar cleared her throat. "Even my brother, Shoab, says it," she
said. "They will leave Usul no choice."
Then it has come, Jessica thought. And Paul will have to handle it himself.
The Reverend Mother dare not become involved in the succession.
Alia freed her hand from her mother's, said: "I will go with Tharthar and
listen to the young men. Perhaps there is a way."
Jessica met Tharthar's gaze, but spoke to Alia: "Go, then. And report to me
as soon as you can."
"We do not want this thing to happen, Reverend Mother," Tharthar said.

"We do not want it," Jessica agreed. "The tribe needs all its strength." She
glanced at Harah. "Will you go with them?"
Harah answered the unspoken part of the question: "Tharthar will allow no
harm to befall Alia. She knows we will soon be wives together, she and I, to
share the same man. We have talked, Tharthar and I." Harah looked up at
Tharthar, back to Jessica. "We have an understanding."
Tharthar held out a hand for Alia, said: "We must hurry. The young men are
leaving."
They pressed through the hangings, the child's hand in the small woman's
hand, but the child seemed to be leading.
"If Paul-Muad'Dib slays Stilgar, this will not serve the tribe," Harah said.
"Always before, it has been the way of succession, but times have changed."
"Times have changed for you, as well," Jessica said.
"You cannot think I doubt the outcome of such a battle," Harah said. "Usul
could not but win."
"That was my meaning," Jessica said.
"And you think my personal feelings enter into my judgment," Harah said. She
shook her head, her water rings tinkling at her neck. "How wrong you are.
Perhaps you think, as well, that I regret not being the chosen of Usul, that I
am jealous of Chani?"
"You make your own choice as you are able," Jessica said.
"I pity Chani," Harah said.
Jessica stiffened. "What do you mean?"
"I know what you think of Chani," Harah said. "You think she is not the wife
for your son."
Jessica settled back, relaxed on her cushions. She shrugged. "Perhaps."
"You could be right," Harah said. "If you are, you may find a surprising
ally -- Chani herself. She wants whatever is best for Him."
Jessica swallowed past a sudden tightening in her throat. "Chani's very dear
to me," she said. "She could be no --"
"Your rugs are very dirty in here," Harah said. She swept her gaze around
the floor, avoiding Jessica's eyes. "So many people tramping through here all
the time. You really should have them cleaned more often."

You cannot avoid the interplay of politics within an orthodox religion. This

-from "Muad'Dib: The Religious Issues" by the Princess Irulan
Paul waited on the sand outside the gigantic maker's line of approach. I
must not wait like a smuggler -- impatient and jittering, he reminded himself. I
must be part of the desert.
The thing was only minutes away now, filling the morning with the frictionhissing of its passage. Its great teeth within the cavern-circle of its mouth
spread like some enormous flower. The spice odor from it dominated the air.
Paul's stillsuit rode easily on his body and he was only distantly aware of
his nose plugs, the breathing mask. Stilgar's teaching, the painstaking hours on
the sand, overshadowed all else.
"How far outside the maker's radius must you stand in pea sand?" Stilgar had
asked him.
And he had answered correctly: "Half a meter for every meter of the maker's
diameter."
"Why?"
"To avoid the vortex of its passage and still have time to run in and mount
it."
"You've ridden the little ones bred for the seed and the Water of Life,"
Stilgar had said. "But what you'll summon for your test is a wild maker, an old
man of the desert. You must have proper respect for such a one."
Now the thumper's deep drumming blended with the hiss of the approaching
worm. Paul breathed deeply, smelling mineral bitterness of sand even through his
filters. The wild maker, the old man of the desert, loomed, almost on him. Its
cresting front segments threw a sandwave that would sweep across his knees.
Come up, you lovely monster, he thought. Up. You hear me calling. Come up.
Come up.
The wave lifted his feet. Surface dust swept across him. He steadied
himself, his world dominated by the passage of that sand-clouded curving wall,
that segmented cliff, the ring lines sharply defined in it.
Paul lifted his hooks, sighted along them, leaned in. He felt them bite and
pull. He leaped upward, planting his feet against that wall, leaning out against
the clinging barbs. This was the true instant of the testing: if he had planted
the hooks correctly at the leading edge of a ring segment, opening the segment,
the worm would not roll down and crush him.
The worm slowed. It glided across the thumper, silencing it. Slowly, it
began to roll -- up, up -- bringing those irritant barbs as high as possible,
away from the sand that threatened the soft inner lapping of its ring segment.
Paul found himself riding upright atop the worm. He felt exultant, like an
emperor surveying his world. He suppressed a sudden urge to cavort there, to
turn the worm, to show off his mastery of this creature.
Suddenly he understood why Stilgar had warned him once about brash young men
who danced and played with these monsters, doing handstands on their backs,
removing both hooks and replanting them before the worm could spill them.
Leaving one hook in place, Paul released the other and planted it lower down
the side. When the second hook was firm and tested, he brought down the first
one, thus worked his way down the side. The maker rolled, and as it rolled, it
turned, coming around the sweep of flour sand where the others waited.
Paul saw them come up, using their hooks to climb, but avoiding the
sensitive ring edges until they were on top. They rode at last in a triple line
behind him, steadied against their hooks.
Stilgar moved up through the ranks, checked the positioning of Paul's hooks,
glanced up at Paul's smiling face.
"You did it, eh?" Stilgar asked, raising his voice above the hiss of their
passage. "That's what you think? You did it?" He straightened. "Now I tell you
that was a very sloppy job. We have twelve-year-olds who do better. There was
drumsand to your left where you waited. You could not retreat there if the worm
turned that way."
The smile slipped from Paul's face. "I saw the drumsand."
"Then why did you not signal for one of us to take up position secondary to
you? It was a thing you could do even in the test."
Paul swallowed, faced into the wind of their passage.
"You think it bad of me to say this now," Stilgar said. "It is my duty. I
think of your worth to the troop. If you had stumbled into that drumsand, the
maker would've turned toward you."
In spite of a surge of anger, Paul knew that Stilgar spoke the truth. It
took a long minute and the full effort of the training he had received from his
mother for Paul to recapture a feeling of calm. "I apologize," he said. "It will
not happen again."
"In a tight position, always leave yourself a secondary, someone to take the
maker if you cannot," Stilgar said. "Remember that we work together. That way,
we're certain. We work together, eh?"
He slapped Paul's shoulder.
"We work together," Paul agreed.
"Now," Stilgar said, and his voice was harsh, "show me you know how to
handle a maker. Which side are we on?"
Paul glanced down at the scaled ring surface on which they stood, noted the
character and size of the scales, the way they grew larger off to his right,
smaller to his left. Every worm, he knew, moved characteristically with one side
up more frequently. As it grew older, the characteristic up-side became an
almost constant thing. Bottom scales grew larger, heavier, smoother. Top scales
could be told by size alone on a big worm.
Shifting his hooks, Paul moved to the left. He motioned flankers down to
open segments along the side and keep the worm on a straight course as it
rolled. When he had it turned, he motioned two steersmen out of the line and
into positions ahead.
"Ach, haiiiii-yoh!" he shouted in the traditional call. The left-side
steersman opened a ring segment there.
In a majestic circle, the maker turned to protect its opened segment. Full
around it came and when it was headed back to the south, Paul shouted: "Geyrat!"
The steersman released his hook. The maker lined out in a straight course.
Stilgar said. "Very good, Paul Muad'Dib. With plenty of practice, you may
yet become a sandrider."
Paul frowned, thinking: Was I not first up?
From behind him there came sudden laughter. The troop began chanting,
flinging his name against the sky.
"Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!"
And far to the rear along the worm's surface, Paul heard the beat of the
goaders pounding the tail segments. The worm began picking up speed. Their robes
flapped in the wind. The abrasive sound of their passage increased.
Paul looked back through the troop, found Chani's face among them. He looked
at her as he spoke to Stilgar. "Then I am a sandrider, Stil?"
"Hal yawm! You are a sandrider this day."
"Then I may choose our destination?"
"That's the way of it."
"And I am a Fremen born this day here in the Habbanya erg. I have had no
life before this day. I was as a child until this day."
"Not quite a child," Stilgar said. He fastened a corner of his hood where
the wind was whipping it.
"But there was a cork sealing off my world, and that cork has been pulled."
"There is no cork."
"I would go south, Stilgar -- twenty thumpers. I would see this land we
make, this land that I've only seen through the eyes of others."
And I would see my son and my family, he thought. I need time now to
consider the future that is a past within my mind. The turmoil comes and if I'm
not where I can unravel it, the thing will run wild.
Stilgar looked at him with a steady, measuring gaze. Paul kept his attention
on Chani, seeing the interest quicken in her face, noting also the excitement
his words had kindled in the troop.
"The men are eager to raid with you in the Harkonnen sinks," Stilgar said.
"The sinks are only a thumper away."
"The Fedaykin have raided with me," Paul said. "They'll raid with me again
until no Harkonnen breathes Arrakeen air."
Stilgar studied him as they rode, and Paul realized the man was seeing this
moment through the memory of how he had risen to command of the Tabr sietch and
to leadership of the Council of Leaders now that Liet-Kynes was dead.
He has heard the reports of unrest among the young Fremen, Paul thought.
"Do you wish a gathering of the leaders?" Stilgar asked.

Eyes blazed among the young men of the troop. They swayed as they rode, and
they watched. And Paul saw the look of unrest in Chani's glance, the way she
looked from Stilgar, who was her uncle, to Paul-Muad'Dib, who was her mate.
"You cannot guess what I want," Paul said.
And he thought: I cannot back down. I must hold control over these people.
"You are mudir of the sandride this day," Stilgar said. Cold formality rang
in his voice: "How do you use this power?"
We need time to relax, time for cool reflection, Paul thought.
"We shall go south," Paul said.
"Even if I say we shall turn back to the north when this day is over?"
"We shall go south," Paul repeated.
A sense of inevitable dignity enfolded Stilgar as he pulled his robe tightly
around him. "There will be a Gathering," he said. "I will send the messages."
He thinks I will call him out, Paul thought. And he knows he cannot stand
against me.
Paul faced south, feeling the wind against his exposed cheeks, thinking of
the necessities that went into his decisions.
They do not know how it is, he thought.
But he knew he could not let any consideration deflect him. He had to remain
on the central line of the time storm he could see in the future. There would
come an instant when it could be unraveled, but only if he were where he could
cut the central knot of it.
I will not call him out if it can be helped, he thought. If there's another
way to prevent the jihad . . .
"We'll camp for the evening meal and prayer at Cave of Birds beneath
Habbanya Ridge," Stilgar said. He steadied himself with one hook against the
swaying of the maker, gestured ahead at a low rock barrier rising out of the
desert.
Paul studied the cliff, the great streaks of rock crossing it like waves. No
green, no blossom softened that rigid horizon. Beyond it stretched the way to
the southern desert -- a course of at least ten days and nights, as fast as they
could goad the makers.
Twenty thumpers.
The way led far beyond the Harkonnen patrols. He knew how it would be. The
dreams had shown him. One day, as they went, there 'd be a faint change of color
on the far horizon -- such a slight change that he might feel he was imagining
it out of his hopes -- and there would be the new sietch.
"Does my decision suit Muad'Dib?" Stilgar asked. Only the faintest touch of
sarcasm tinged his voice, but Fremen ears around them, alert to every tone in a
bird's cry or a cielago's piping message, heard the sarcasm and watched Paul to
see what he would do.
"Stilgar heard me swear my loyalty to him when we consecrated the Fedaykin,"
Paul said. "My death commandos know I spoke with honor. Does Stilgar doubt it?"
Real pain exposed itself in Paul's voice. Stilgar heard it and lowered his
gaze.
"Usul, the companion of my sietch, him I would never doubt," Stilgar said.
"But you are Paul-Muad'Dib, the Atreides Duke, and you are the Lisan al-Gaib,
the Voice from the Outer World. These men I don't even know."
Paul turned away to watch the Habbanya Ridge climb out of the desert. The
maker beneath them still felt strong and willing. It could carry them almost
twice the distance of any other in Fremen experience. He knew it. There was
nothing outside the stories told to children that could match this old man of
the desert. It was the stuff of a new legend, Paul realized.
A hand gripped his shoulder.
Paul looked at it, followed the arm to the face beyond it -- the dark eyes
of Stilgar exposed between filter mask and stillsuit hood.

"The one who led Tabr sietch before me," Stilgar said, "he was my friend. We
shared dangers. He owed me his life many a time . . . and I owed him mine."
"I am your friend, Stilgar," Paul said.
"No man doubts it," Stilgar said. He removed his hand, shrugged. "It's the
way."
Paul saw that Stilgar was too immersed in the Fremen way to consider the
possibility of any other. Here a leader took the reins from the dead hands of
his predecessor, or slew among the strongest of his tribe if a leader died in
the desert. Stilgar had risen to be a naib in that way.
"We should leave this maker in deep sand," Paul said.
"Yes," Stilgar agreed. "We could walk to the cave from here."
"We've ridden him far enough that he'll bury himself and sulk for a day or
so," Paul said.
"You're the mudir of the sandride," Stilgar said. "Say when we . . ." He
broke off, stared at the eastern sky.
Paul whirled. The spice-blue overcast on his eyes made the sky appear dark,
a richly filtered azure against which a distant rhythmic flashing stood out in
sharp contrast.
Ornithopter!
"One small 'thopter," Stilgar said.
"Could be a scout," Paul said. "Do you think they've seen us."
"At this distance we're just a worm on the surface," Stilgar said. He
motioned with his left hand. "Off. Scatter on the sand."
The troop began working down the worm's sides, dropping off, blending with
the sand beneath their cloaks. Paul marked where Chani dropped. Presently, only
he and Stilgar remained.
"First up, last off," Paul said.
Stilgar nodded, dropped down the side on his hooks, leaped onto the sand.
Paul waited until the maker was safely clear of the scatter area, then released
his hooks. This was the tricky moment with a worm not completely exhausted.
Freed of its goads and hooks, the big worm began burrowing into the sand.
Paul ran lightly back along its broad surface, judged his moment carefully and
leaped off. He landed running, lunged against the slipface of a dune the way he
had been taught, and hid himself beneath the cascade of sand over his robe.
Now, the waiting . . .
Paul turned, gently, exposed a crack of sky beneath a crease in his robe. He
imagined the others back along their path doing the same.
He heard the beat of the 'thopter's wings before he saw it. There was a
whisper of jetpods and it came over his patch of desert, turned in a broad arc
toward the ridge.
An unmarked 'thopter, Paul noted.
It flew out of sight beyond Habbanya Ridge.
A bird cry sounded over the desert. Another.
Paul shook himself free of sand, climbed to the dune top. Other figures
stood out in a line trailing away from the ridge. He recognized Chani and
Stilgar among them.
Stilgar signaled toward the ridge.
They gathered and began the sandwalk, gliding over the surface in a broken
rhythm that would disturb no maker. Stilgar paced himself beside Paul along the
windpacked crest of a dune.
"It was a smuggler craft," Stilgar said.
"So it seemed," Paul said. "But this is deep into the desert, for
smugglers."
"They've their difficulties with patrols, too," Stilgar said.
"If they come this deep, they may go deeper," Paul said.
"True."
"It wouldn't be well for them to see what they could see if they ventured
too deep into the south. Smugglers sell information, too."
"They were hunting spice, don't you think?" Stilgar asked.
"There will be a wing and a crawler waiting somewhere for that one," Paul
said. "We've spice. Let's bait a patch of sand and catch us some smugglers. They
should be taught that this is our land and our men need practice with the new
weapons."
"Now, Usul speaks," Stilgar said. "Usul thinks Fremen."
But Usul must give way to decisions that match a terrible purpose, Paul
thought.
And the storm was gathering.
= = = = = =
When law and duty are one, united by religion, you never become fully conscious,
fully aware of yourself. You are always a little less than an individual.
-from "Muad'Dib: The Ninety-Nine Wonders of the Universe" by Princess Irulan
The smuggler's spice factory with its parent carrier and ring of drone
ornithopters came over a lifting of dunes like a swarm of insects following its
queen. Ahead of the swarm lay one of the low rock ridges that lifted from the
desert floor like small imitations of the Shield Wall. The dry beaches of the
ridge were swept clean by a recent storm.
In the con-bubble of the factory, Gurney Halleck leaned forward, adjusted
the oil lenses of his binoculars and examined the landscape. Beyond the ridge,
he could see a dark patch that might be a spiceblow, and he gave the signal to a
hovering ornithopter that sent it to investigate.
The 'thopter waggled its wings to indicate it had the signal. It broke away
from the swarm, sped down toward the darkened sand, circled the area with its
detectors dangling close to the surface.
Almost immediately, it went through the wing-tucked dip and circle that told
the waiting factory that spice had been found.
Gurney sheathed his binoculars, knowing the others had seen the signal. He
liked this spot. The ridge offered some shielding and protection. This was deep
in the desert, an unlikely place for an ambush . . . still . . . Gurney signaled
for a crew to hover over the ridge, to scan it, sent reserves to take up station
in pattern around the area -- not too high because then they could be seen from
afar by Harkonnen detectors.
He doubted, though, that Harkonnen patrols would be this far south. This was
still Fremen country.
Gurney checked his weapons, damning the fate that made shields useless out
here. Anything that summoned a worm had to be avoided at all costs. He rubbed
the inkvine scar along his jaw, studying the scene, decided it would be safest
to lead a ground party through the ridge. Inspection on foot was still the most
certain. You couldn't be too careful when Fremen and Harkonnen were at each
other's throats.
It was Fremen that worried him here. They didn't mind trading for all the
spice you could afford, but they were devils on the warpath if you stepped foot
where they forbade you to go. And they were so devilishly cunning of late.
It annoyed Gurney, the cunning and adroitness in battle of these natives.
They displayed a sophistication in warfare as good as anything he had ever
encountered, and he had been trained by the best fighters in the universe then
seasoned in battles where only the superior few survived.
Again Gurney scanned the landscape, wondering why he felt uneasy. Perhaps it
was the worm they had seen . . . but that was on the other side of the ridge.

A head popped up into the con-bubble beside Gurney -- the factory commander,
a one-eyed old pirate with full beard, the blue eyes and milky teeth of a spice
diet.
"Looks like a rich patch, sir," the factory commander said. "Shall I take
'er in?"
"Come down at the edge of that ridge," Gurney ordered. "Let me disembark
with my men. You can tractor out to the spice from there. We'll have a look at
that rock."
"Aye."
"In case of trouble," Gurney said, "save the factory. We'll lift in the
'thopters."
The factory commander saluted. "Aye, sir." He popped back down through the
hatch.
Again Gurney scanned the horizon. He had to respect the possibility that
there were Fremen here and he was trespassing. Fremen worried him, their
toughness and unpredictability. Many things about this business worried him, but
the rewards were great. The fact that he couldn't send spotters high overhead
worried him, too. The necessity of radio silence added to his uneasiness.
The factory crawler turned, began to descend. Gently it glided down to the
dry beach at the foot of the ridge. Treads touched sand.
Gurney opened the bubble dome, released his safety straps. The instant the
factory stopped, he was out, slamming the bubble closed behind him, scrambling
out over the tread guards to swing down to the sand beyond the emergency
netting. The five men of his personal guard were out with him, emerging from the
nose hatch. Others released the factory's carrier wing. It detached, lifted away
to fly in a parking circle low overhead.
Immediately the big factory crawler lurched off, swinging away from the
ridge toward the dark patch of spice out on the sand.
A 'thopter swooped down nearby, skidded to a stop. Another followed and
another. They disgorged Gurney's platoon and lifted to hoverflight.
Gurney tested his muscles in his stillsuit, stretching. He left the filter
mask off his face, losing moisture for the sake of a greater need -- the
carrying power of his voice if he had to shout commands. He began climbing up
into the rocks, checking the terrain -- pebbles and pea sand underfoot, the
smell of spice.
Good site for an emergency base, he thought. Might be sensible to bury a few
supplies here.
He glanced back, watching his men spread out as they followed him. Good men,
even the new ones he hadn't had time to test. Good men. Didn't have to be told
every time what to do. Not a shield glimmer showed on any of them. No cowards in
this bunch, carrying shields into the desert where a worm could sense the field
and come to rob them of the spice they found.
From this slight elevation in the rocks, Gurney could see the spice patch
about half a kilometer away and the crawler just reaching the near edge. He
glanced up at the coverflight, noting the altitude -- not too high. He nodded to
himself, turned to resume his climb up the ridge.
In that instant, the ridge erupted.
Twelve roaring paths of flame streaked upward to the hovering 'thopters and
carrier wing. There came a blasting of metal from the factory crawler, and the
rocks around Gurney were full of hooded fighting men.
Gurney had time to think: By the horns of the Great Mother! Rockets! They
dare to use rockets!
Then he was face to face with a hooded figure who crouched low, crysknife at
the ready. Two more men stood waiting on the rocks above to left and right. Only
the eyes of the fighting man ahead of him were visible to Gurney between hood
and veil of a sand-colored burnoose, but the crouch and readiness warned him
that here was a trained fighting man. The eyes were the blue-in-blue of the
deep-desert Fremen.
Gurney moved one hand toward his own knife, kept his eyes fixed on the
other's knife. If they dared use rockets, they'd have other projectile weapons.
This moment argued extreme caution. He could tell by sound alone that at least
part of his skycover had been knocked out. There were gruntings, too, the noise
of several struggles behind him.
The eyes of the fighting man ahead of Gurney followed the motion of hand
toward knife, came back to glare into Gurney's eyes.
"Leave the knife in its sheath, Gurney Halleck," the man said.
Gurney hesitated. That voice sounded oddly familiar even through a stillsuit
filter.
"You know my name?" he said.
"You've no need of a knife with me, Gurney," the man said. He straightened,
slipped his crysknife into its sheath back beneath his robe. "Tell your men to
stop their useless resistance."
The man threw his hood back, swung the filter aside.
The shock of what he saw froze Gurney's muscles. He thought at first he was
looking at a ghost image of Duke Leto Atreides. Full recognition came slowly.
"Paul," he whispered. Then louder: "Is it truly Paul?"
"Don't you trust your own eyes?" Paul asked.
"They said you were dead," Gurney rasped. He took a half-step forward.
"Tell your men to submit," Paul commanded. He waved toward the lower reaches
of the ridge.
Gurney turned, reluctant to take his eyes off Paul. He saw only a few knots
of struggle. Hooded desert men seemed to be everywhere around. The factory
crawler lay silent with Fremen standing atop it. There were no aircraft
overhead.
"Stop the fighting," Gurney bellowed. He took a deep breath, cupped his
hands for a megaphone. "This is Gurney Halleck! Stop the fight!"
Slowly, warily, the struggling figures separated. Eyes turned toward him,
questioning.
"These are friends," Gurney called.
"Fine friends!" someone shouted back. "Half our people murdered."
"It's a mistake," Gurney said. "Don't add to it."
He turned back to Paul, stared into the youth's blue-blue Fremen eyes.
A smile touched Paul's mouth, but there was a hardness in the expression
that reminded Gurney of the Old Duke, Paul's grandfather. Gurney saw then the
sinewy harshness in Paul that had never before been seen in an Atreides -- a
leathery look to the skin, a squint to the eyes and calculation in the glance
that seemed to weigh everything in sight.
"They said you were dead," Gurney repeated.
"And it seemed the best protection to let them think so," Paul said.
Gurney realized that was all the apology he'd ever get for having been
abandoned to his own resources, left to believe his young Duke . . . his friend,
was dead. He wondered then if there were anything left here of the boy he had
known and trained in the ways of fighting men.
Paul took a step closer to Gurney, found that his eyes were smarting.
"Gurney . . . "
It seemed to happen of itself, and they were embracing, pounding each other
on the back, feeling the reassurance of solid flesh.
"You young pup! You young pup!" Gurney kept saying.
And Paul: "Gurney, man! Gurney, man!"
Presently, they stepped apart, looked at each other. Gurney took a deep
breath. "So you're why the Fremen have grown so wise in battle tactics. I
might've known. They keep doing things I could've planned myself. If I'd only
known . . . " He shook his head. "If you'd only got word to me, lad. Nothing
would've stopped me. I'd have come arunning and . . . "
A look in Paul's eyes stopped him . . . the hard, weighing stare.
Gurney sighed. "Sure, and there'd have been those who wondered why Gurney
Halleck went arunning, and some would've done more than question. They'd have
gone hunting for answers."
Paul nodded, glanced to the waiting Fremen around them -- the looks of
curious appraisal on the faces of the Fedaykin. He turned from the death
commandos back to Gurney. Finding his former swordmaster filled him with
elation. He saw it as a good omen, a sign that he was on the course of the
future where all was well.
With Gurney at my side . . .
Paul glanced down the ridge past the Fedaykin, studied the smuggler crew who
had come with Halleck.
"How do your men stand, Gurney?" he asked.
"They're smugglers all," Gurney said. "They stand where the profit is."
"Little enough profit in our venture," Paul said, and he noted the subtle
finger signal flashed to him by Gurney's right hand -- the old hand code out of
their past. There were men to fear and distrust in the smuggler crew.
Paul pulled at his lip to indicate he understood, looked up at the men
standing guard above them on the rocks. He saw Stilgar there. Memory of the
unsolved problem with Stilgar cooled some of Paul's elation.
"Stilgar," he said, "this is Gurney Halleck of whom you've heard me speak.
My father's master-of-arms, one of the swordmasters who instructed me, an old
friend. He can be trusted in any venture."
"I hear," Stilgar said. "You are his Duke."
Paul stared at the dark visage above him, wondering at the reasons which had
impelled Stilgar to say just that. His Duke. There had been a strange subtle
intonation in Stilgar's voice, as though he would rather have said something
else. And that wasn't like Stilgar, who was a leader of Fremen, a man who spoke
his mind.
My Duke! Gurney thought. He looked anew at Paul. Yes, with Leto dead, the
title fell on Paul's shoulders.
The pattern of the Fremen war on Arrakis began to take on new shape in
Gurney's mind. My Duke! A place that had been dead within him began coming
alive. Only part of his awareness focused on Paul's ordering the smuggler crew
disarmed until they could be questioned.
Gurney's mind returned to the command when he heard some of his men
protesting. He shook his head, whirled. "Are you men deaf?" he barked. "This is
the rightful Duke of Arrakis. Do as he commands."
Grumbling, the smugglers submitted.
Paul moved up beside Gurney, spoke in a low voice. "I'd not have expected
you to walk into this trap, Gurney."
"I'm properly chastened," Gurney said. "I'll wager yon patch of spice is
little more than a sand grain's thickness, a bait to lure us."
"That's a wager you'd win," Paul said. He looked down at the men being
disarmed. "Are there any more of my father's men among your crew?"
"None. We're spread thin. There're a few among the free traders. Most have
spent their profits to leave this place."
"But you stayed."
"I stayed."
"Because Rabban is here," Paul said.
"I thought I had nothing left but revenge," Gurney said.
An oddly chopped cry sounded from the ridgetop. Gurney looked up to see a
Fremen waving his kerchief.
"A maker comes," Paul said. He moved out to a point of rock with Gurney
following, looked off to the southwest. The burrow mound of a worm could be seen
in the middle distance, a dust-crowned track that cut directly through the dunes
on a course toward the ridge.
"He's big enough," Paul said.
A clattering sound lifted from the factory crawler below them. It turned on
its treads like a giant insect, lumbered toward the rocks.
"Too bad we couldn't have saved the carryall," Paul said.
Gurney glanced at him, looked back to the patches of smoke and debris out on
the desert where carryall and ornithopters had been brought down by Fremen
rockets. He felt a sudden pang for the men lost there -- his men, and he said:
"Your father would've been more concerned for the men he couldn't save."
Paul shot a hard stare at him, lowered his gaze. Presently, he said: "They
were your friends, Gurney. I understand. To us, though, they were trespassers
who might see things they shouldn't see. You must understand that."
"I understand it well enough," Gurney said. "Now, I'm curious to see what I
shouldn't."
Paul looked up to see the old and well-remembered wolfish grin on Halleck's
face, the ripple of the inkvine scar along the man's jaw.
Gurney nodded toward the desert below them. Fremen were going about their
business all over the landscape. It struck him that none of them appeared
worried by the approach of the worm.
A thumping sounded from the open dunes beyond the baited patch of spice -- a
deep drumming that seemed to be heard through their feet. Gurney saw Fremen
spread out across the sand there in the path of the worm.
The worm came on like some great sandfish, cresting the surface, its rings
rippling and twisting. In a moment, from his vantage point above the desert,
Gurney saw the taking of a worm -- the daring leap of the first hookman, the
turning of the creature, the way an entire band of men went up the scaly,
glistening curve of the worm's side.
"There's one of the things you shouldn't have seen," Paul said.
"There's been stories and rumors," Gurney said. "But it's not a thing easy
to believe without seeing it." He shook his head. "The creature all men on
Arrakis fear, you treat it like a riding animal."
"You heard my father speak of desert power," Paul said. "There it is. The
surface of this planet is ours. No storm nor creature nor condition can stop
us."
Us, Gurney thought. He means the Fremen. He speaks of himself as one of
them. Again, Gurney looked at the spice blue in Paul's eyes. His own eyes, he
knew, had a touch of the color, but smugglers could get offworld foods and there
was a subtle caste implication in the tone of the eyes among them. They spoke of
"the touch of the spicebrush" to mean a man had gone too native. And there was
always a hint of distrust in the idea.
"There was a time when we did not ride the maker in the light of day in
these latitudes," Paul said. "But Rabban has little enough air cover left that
he can waste it looking for a few specks in the sand." He looked at Gurney.
"Your aircraft were a shock to us here."
To us . . . to us . . .
Gurney shook his head to drive out such thoughts. "We weren't the shock to
you that you were to us," he said.
"What's the talk of Rabban in the sinks and villages?" Paul asked.
"They say they've fortified the graben villages to the point where you
cannot harm them. They say they need only sit inside their defenses while you
wear yourselves out in futile attack."
"In a word," Paul said, "they're immobilized."
"While you can go where you will," Gurney said.
"It's a tactic I learned from you," Paul said. "They've lost the initiative,
which means they've lost the war."
Gurney smiled, a slow, knowing expression.

"Our enemy is exactly where I want him to be," Paul said. He glanced at
Gurney. "Well, Gurney, do you enlist with me for the finish of this campaign?"
"Enlist?" Gurney stared at him. "My Lord, I've never left your service.
You're the only one left me . . . to think you dead. And I, being cast adrift,
made what shrift I could, waiting for the moment I might sell my life for what
it's worth -- the death of Rabban."
An embarrassed silence settled over Paul.
A woman came climbing up the rocks toward them, her eyes between stillsuit
hood and facemask flicking between Paul and his companion. She stopped in front
of Paul. Gurney noted the possessive air about her, the way she stood close to
Paul.
"Chani," Paul said, "this is Gurney Halleck. You've heard me speak of him."
She looked at Halleck, back to Paul. "I have heard."
"Where did the men go on the maker?" Paul asked.
"They but diverted it to give us time to save the equipment."
"Well then . . ." Paul broke off, sniffed the air.
"There's wind coming," Chani said.
A voice called out from the ridgetop above them: "Ho, there -- the wind!"
Gurney saw a quickening of motion among the Fremen now -- a rushing about
and sense of hurry. A thing the worm had not ignited was brought about by fear
of the wind. The factory crawler lumbered up onto the dry beach below them and a
way was opened for it among the rocks . . . and the rocks closed behind it so
neatly that the passage escaped his eyes.
"Have you many such hiding places?" Gurney asked.
"Many times many," Paul said. He looked at Chani. "Find Korba. Tell him that
Gurney has warned me there are men among this smuggler crew who're not to be
trusted."
She looked once at Gurney, back to Paul, nodded, and was off down the rocks,
leaping with a gazelle-like agility.
"She is your woman," Gurney said.
"The mother of my firstborn," Paul said. "There's another Leto among the
Atreides."
Gurney accepted this with only a widening of the eyes.
Paul watched the action around them with a critical eye. A curry color
dominated the southern sky now and there came fitful bursts and gusts of wind
that whipped dust around their heads.
"Seal your suit," Paul said. And he fastened the mask and hood about his
face.
Gurney obeyed, thankful for the filters.
Paul spoke, his voice muffled by the filter: "Which of your crew don't you
trust, Gurney?"
"There're some new recruits," Gurney said. "Offworlders . . . " He
hesitated, wondering at himself suddenly. Offworlders. The word had come so
easily to his tongue.
"Yes?" Paul said.
"They're not like the usual fortune-hunting lot we get," Gurney said.
"They're tougher."
"Harkonnen spies?" Paul asked.
"I think m'Lord, that they report to no Harkonnen. I suspect they're men of
the Imperial service. They have a hint of Salusa Secundus about them."
Paul shot a sharp glance at him. "Sardaukar?"
Gurney shrugged. "They could be, but it's well masked."
Paul nodded, thinking how easily Gurney had fallen back into the pattern of
Atreides retainer . . . but with subtle reservations . . . differences. Arrakis
had changed him, too.
Two hooded Fremen emerged from the broken rock below them, began climbing
upward. One of them carried a large black bundle over one shoulder.

"Where are my crew now?" Gurney asked.
"Secure in the rocks below us," Paul said. "We've a cave here -- Cave of
Birds. We'll decide what to do with them after the storm."
A voice called from above them: "Muad'Dib!"
Paul turned at the call, saw a Fremen guard motioning them down to the cave.
Paul signaled he had heard.
Gurney studying him with a new expression. "You're Muad'Dib?" he asked.
"You're the will-o'-the-sand?"
"It's my Fremen name," Paul said.
Gurney turned away, feeling an oppressive sense of foreboding. Half his own
crew dead on the sand, the others captive. He did not care about the new
recruits, the suspicious ones, but among the others were good men, friends,
people for whom he felt responsible. "We'll decide what to do with them after
the storm." That's what Paul had said, Muad'Dib had said. And Gurney recalled
the stories told of Muad'Dib, the Lisan al-Gaib -- how he had taken the skin of
a Harkonnen officer to make his drumheads, how he was surrounded by death
commandos, Fedaykin who leaped into battle with their death chants on their
lips.
Him.
The two Fremen climbing up the rocks leaped lightly to a shelf in front of
Paul. The dark-faced one said: "All secure, Muad'Dib. We best get below now."
"Right."
Gurney noted the tone of the man's voice -- half command and half request.
This was the man called Stilgar, another figure of the new Fremen legends.
Paul looked at the bundle the other man carried, said: "Korba, what's in the
bundle?"
Stilgar answered: " 'Twas in the crawler. It had the initial of your friend
here and it contains a baliset. Many times have I heard you speak of the prowess
of Gurney Halleck on the baliset."
Gurney studied the speaker, seeing the edge of black beard above the
stillsuit mask, the hawk stare, the chiseled nose.
"You've a companion who thinks, m'Lord," Gurney said. "Thank you, Stilgar."
Stilgar signaled for his companion to pass the bundle to Gurney, said:
"Thank your Lord Duke. His countenance earns your admittance here."
Gurney accepted the bundle, puzzled by the hard undertones in this
conversation. There was an air of challenge about the man, and Gurney wondered
if it could be a feeling of jealousy in the Fremen. Here was someone called
Gurney Halleck who'd known Paul even in the times before Arrakis, a man who
shared a camaraderie that Stilgar could never invade.
"You are two I'd have be friends," Paul said.
"Stilgar, the Fremen, is a name of renown," Gurney said. "Any killer of
Harkonnens I'd feel honored to count among my friends."
"Will you touch hands with my friend Gurney Halleck, Stilgar?" Paul asked.
Slowly, Stilgar extended his hand, gripped the heavy calluses of Gurney's
swordhand. "There're few who haven't heard the name of Gurney Halleck," he said,
and released his grip. He turned to Paul. "The storm comes rushing."
"At once," Paul said.
Stilgar turned away, led them down through the rocks, a twisting and turning
path into a shadowed cleft that admitted them to the low entrance of a cave. Men
hurried to fasten a doorseal behind them. Glowglobes showed a broad, domeceilinged space with a raised ledge on one side and a passage leading off from
it.
Paul leaped to the ledge with Gurney right behind him, led the way into the
passage. The others headed for another passage opposite the entrance. Paul led
the way through an anteroom and into a chamber with dark, wine-colored hangings
on its walls.

"We can have some privacy here for a while," Paul said. "The others will
respect my --"
An alarm cymbal clanged from the outer chamber, was followed by shouting and
clashing of weapons. Paul whirled, ran back through the anteroom and out onto
the atrium lip above the outer chamber. Gurney was right behind, weapon drawn.
Beneath them on the floor of the cave swirled a melee of struggling figures.
Paul stood an instant assessing the scene, separating the Fremen robes and
bourkas from the costumes of those they opposed. Senses that his mother had
trained to detect the most subtle clues picked out a significant fact -- the
Fremen fought against men wearing smuggler robes, but the smugglers were
crouched in trios, backed into triangles where pressed.
That habit of close fighting was a trademark of the Imperial Sardaukar.
A Fedaykin in the crowd saw Paul, and his battlecry was lifted to echo in
the chamber: "Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!"
Another eye had also picked Paul out. A black knife came hurtling toward
him. Paul dodged, heard the knife clatter against stone behind him, glanced to
see Gurney retrieve it.
The triangular knots were being pressed back now.
Gurney held the knife up in front of Paul's eyes, pointed to the hairline
yellow coil of Imperial color, the golden lion crest, multifaceted eyes at the
pommel.
Sardaukar for certain.
Paul stepped out to the lip of the ledge. Only three of the Sardaukar
remained. Bloody rag mounds of Sardaukar and Fremen lay in a twisted pattern
across the chamber.
"Hold!" Paul shouted. "The Duke Paul Atreides commands you to hold!"
The fighting wavered, hesitated.
"You Sardaukar!" Paul called to the remaining group. "By whose orders do you
threaten a ruling Duke?" And, quickly, as his men started to press in around the
Sardaukar: "Hold, I say!"
One of the cornered trio straightened. "Who says we're Sardaukar?" he
demanded.
Paul took the knife from Gurney, held it aloft. "This says you're
Sardaukar."
"Then who says you're a ruling Duke?" the man demanded.
Paul gestured to the Fedaykin. "These men say I'm a ruling Duke. Your own
emperor bestowed Arrakis on House Atreides. I am House Atreides."
The Sardaukar stood silent, fidgeting.
Paul studied the man -- tall, flat-featured, with a pale scar across half
his left cheek. Anger and confusion were betrayed in his manner, but still there
was that pride about him without which a Sardaukar appeared undressed -- and
with which he could appear fully clothed though naked.
Paul glanced to one of his Fedaykin lieutenants, said: "Korba, how came they
to have weapons?"
"They held back knives concealed in cunning pockets within their
stillsuits," the lieutenant said.
Paul surveyed the dead and wounded across the chamber, brought his attention
back to the lieutenant. There was no need for words. The lieutenant lowered his
eyes.
"Where is Chani?" Paul asked and waited, breath held, for the answer.
"Stilgar spirited her aside." He nodded toward the other passage, glanced at
the dead and wounded. "I hold myself responsible for this mistake, Muad'Dib."
"How many of these Sardaukar were there, Gurney?" Paul asked.
"Ten."
Paul leaped lightly to the floor of the chamber, strode across to stand
within striking distance of the Sardaukar spokesman.

A tense air came over the Fedaykin. They did not like him thus exposed to
danger. This was the thing they were pledged to prevent because the Fremen
wished to preserve the wisdom of Muad'Dib.
Without turning, Paul spoke to his lieutenant: "How many are our
casualties?"
"Four wounded, two dead, Muad'Dib."
Paul saw motion beyond the Sardaukar, Chani and Stilgar were standing in the
other passage. He returned his attention to the Sardaukar, staring into the
offworld whites of the spokesman's eyes. "You, what is your name?" Paul
demanded.
The man stiffened, glanced left and right.
"Don't try it," Paul said. "It's obvious to me that you were ordered to seek
out and destroy Muad'Dib. I'll warrant you were the ones suggested seeking spice
in the deep desert."
A gasp from Gurney behind him brought a thin smile to Paul's lips.
Blood suffused the Sardaukar's face.
"What you see before you is more than Muad'Dib," Paul said. "Seven of you
are dead for two of us. Three for one. Pretty good against Sardaukar, eh?"
The man came up on his toes, sank back as the Fedaykin pressed forward.
"I asked your name," Paul said, and he called up the subtleties of Voice:
"Tell me your name!"
"Captain Aramsham, Imperial Sardaukar!" the man snapped. His jaw dropped. He
stared at Paul in confusion. The manner about him that had dismissed this cavern
as a barbarian warren melted away.
"Well, Captain Aramsham," Paul said, "the Harkonnens would pay dearly to
learn what you now know. And the Emperor -- what he wouldn't give to learn an
Atreides still lives despite his treachery."
The captain glanced left and right at the two men remaining to him. Paul
could almost see the thoughts turning over in the man's head. Sardaukar did not
submit, but the Emperor had to learn of this threat.
Still using the Voice, Paul said: "Submit, Captain."
The man at the captain's left leaped without warning toward Paul, met the
flashing impact of his own captain's knife in his chest. The attacker hit the
floor in a sodden heap with the knife still in him.
The captain faced his sole remaining companion. "I decide what best serves
His Majesty," he said. "Understood?"
The other Sardaukar's shoulders slumped.
"Drop your weapon," the captain said.
The Sardaukar obeyed.
The captain returned his attention to Paul. "I have killed a friend for
you," he said. "Let us always remember that."
"You're my prisoners," Paul said. "You submitted to me. Whether you live or
die is of no importance." He motioned to his guard to take the two Sardaukar,
signaled the lieutenant who had searched the prisoners.
The guard moved in, hustled the Sardaukar away.
Paul bent toward his lieutenant.
"Muad'Dib," the man said. "I failed you in . . . "
"The failure was mine, Korba," Paul said. "I should've warned you what to
seek. In the future, when searching Sardaukar, remember this. Remember, too,
that each has a false toenail or two that can be combined with other items
secreted about their bodies to make an effective transmitter. They'll have more
than one false tooth. They carry coils of shigawire in their hair -- so fine you
can barely detect it, yet strong enough to garrote a man and cut off his head in
the process. With Sardaukar, you must scan them, scope them -- both reflex and
hard ray -- cut off every scrap of body hair. And when you're through, be
certain you haven't discovered everything."
He looked up at Gurney, who had moved close to listen.

"Then we best kill them," the lieutenant said.
Paul shook his head, still looking at Gurney. "No. I want them to escape."
Gurney stared at him.
"Sire . . . " he breathed.
"Yes?"
"Your man here is right. Kill those prisoners at once. Destroy all evidence
of them. You've shamed Imperial Sardaukar! When the Emperor learns that he'll
not rest until he has you over a slow fire."
"The Emperor's not likely to have that power over me," Paul said. He spoke
slowly, coldly. Something had happened inside him while he faced the Sardaukar.
A sum of decisions had accumulated in his awareness. "Gurney," he said, "are
there many Guildsmen around Rabban?"
Gurney straightened, eyes narrowed. "Your question makes no . . . "
"Are there?" Paul barked.
"Arrakis is crawling with Guild agents. They're buying spice as though it
were the most precious thing in the universe. Why else do you think we ventured
this far into . . . "
"It is the most precious thing in the universe," Paul said. "To them."
He looked toward Stilgar and Chani who were now crossing the chamber toward
him. "And we control it, Gurney."
"The Harkonnens control it!" Gurney protested.
"The people who can destroy a thing, they control it," Paul said. He waved a
hand to silence further remarks from Gurney, nodded to Stilgar who stopped in
front of Paul, Chani beside him.
Paul took the Sardaukar knife in his left hand, presented it to Stilgar.
"You live for the good of the tribe," Paul said. "Could you draw my life's blood
with that knife?"
"For the good of the tribe," Stilgar growled.
"Then use that knife," Paul said.
"Are you calling me out?" Stilgar demanded.
"If I do," Paul said, "I shall stand there without weapon and let you slay
me."
Stilgar drew in a quick, sharp breath.
Chani said, "Usul!" then glanced at Gurney, back to Paul.
While Stilgar was still weighing his words, Paul said: "You are Stilgar, a
fighting man. When the Sardaukar began fighting here, you were not in the front
of battle. Your first thought was to protect Chani."
"She's my niece," Stilgar said. "If there'd been any doubt of your Fedaykin
handling those scum . . . "
"Why was your first thought of Chani?" Paul demanded.
"It wasn't!"
"Oh?"
"It was of you," Stilgar admitted.
"Do you think you could lift your hand against me?" Paul asked. Stilgar
began to tremble. "It's the way," he muttered.
"It's the way to kill offworld strangers found in the desert and take their
water as a gift from Shai-hulud," Paul said. "Yet you permitted two such to live
one night, my mother and myself."
As Stilgar remained silent, trembling, staring at him, Paul said: "Ways
change, Stil. You have changed them yourself."
Stilgar looked down at the yellow emblem on the knife he held.
"When I am Duke in Arrakeen with Chani by my side, do you think I'll have
time to concern myself with every detail of governing Tabr sietch?" Paul asked.
"Do you concern yourself with the internal problems of every family?"
Stilgar continued staring at the knife.
"Do you think I wish to cut off my right arm?" Paul demanded.
Slowly, Stilgar looked up at him.

"You!" Paul said. "Do you think I wish to deprive myself or the tribe of
your wisdom and strength?"
In a low voice, Stilgar said: "The young man of my tribe whose name is known
to me, this young man I could kill on the challenge floor, Shai-hulud willing.
The Lisan al-Gaib, him I could not harm. You knew this when you handed me this
knife."
"I knew it," Paul agreed.
Stilgar opened his hand. The knife clattered against the stone of the floor.
"Ways change," he said.
"Chani," Paul said, "go to my mother, send her here that her counsel will be
available in --"
"But you said we would go to the south!" she protested.
"I was wrong," he said. "The Harkonnens are not there. The war is not
there."
She took a deep breath, accepting this as a desert woman accepted all
necessities in the midst of a life involved with death.
"You will give my mother a message for her ears alone," Paul said. "Tell her
that Stilgar acknowledges me Duke of Arrakis, but a way must be found to make
the young men accept this without combat."
Chani glanced at Stilgar.
"Do as he says," Stilgar growled. "We both know he could overcome me . . .
and I could not raise my hand against him . . . for the good of the tribe."
"I shall return with your mother," Chani said.
"Send her," Paul said. "Stilgar's instinct was right. I am stronger when you
are safe. You will remain in the sietch."
She started to protest, swallowed it.
"Sihaya," Paul said, using his intimate name for her. He whirled away to the
right, met Gurney's glaring eyes.
The interchange between Paul and the older Fremen had passed as though in a
cloud around Gurney since Paul's reference to his mother.
"Your mother," Gurney said.
"Idaho saved us the night of the raid," Paul said, distracted by the parting
with Chani. "Right now we've --"
"What of Duncan Idaho, m'Lord?" Gurney asked.
"He's dead -- buying us a bit of time to escape."
The she-witch alive! Gurney thought. The one I swore vengeance against,
alive! And it's obvious Duke Paul doesn't know what manner of creature gave him
birth. The evil one! Betrayed his own father to the Harkonnens!
Paul pressed past him, jumped up to the ledge. He glanced back, noted that
the wounded and dead had been removed, and he thought bitterly that here was
another chapter in the legend of Paul Muad'Dib. I didn't even draw my knife, but
it'll be said of this day that I slew twenty Sardaukar by my own hand.
Gurney followed with Stilgar, stepping on ground that he did not even feel.
The cavern with its yellow light of glowglobes was forced out of his thoughts by
rage. The she-witch alive while those she betrayed are bones in lonesome graves.
I must contrive it that Paul learns the truth about her before I slay her.

How often it is that the angry man rages denial of what his inner self is
telling him.
-"The Collected Sayings of Muad'Dib" by the Princess Irulan
The crowd in the cavern assembly chamber radiated that pack feeling Jessica
had sensed the day Paul killed Jamis. There was murmuring nervousness in the
voices. Little cliques gathered like knots among the robes.

Jessica tucked a message cylinder beneath her robe as she emerged to the
ledge from Paul's private quarters. She felt rested after the long journey up
from the south, but still rankled that Paul would not yet permit them to use the
captured ornithopters.
"We do not have full control of the air," he had said. "And we must not
become dependent upon offworld fuel. Both fuel and aircraft must be gathered and
saved for the day of maximum effort."
Paul stood with a group of the younger men near the ledge. The pale light of
glowglobes gave the scene a tinge of unreality. It was like a tableau, but with
the added dimension of warren smells, the whispers, the sounds of shuffling
feet.
She studied her son, wondering why he had not yet trotted out his surprise - Gurney Halleck. Thought of Gurney disturbed her with its memories of an easier
past -- days of love and beauty with Paul's father.
Stilgar waited with a small group of his own at the other end of the ledge.
There was a feeling of inevitable dignity about him, the way he stood without
talking.
We must not lose that man, Jessica thought. Paul's plan must work. Anything
else would be highest tragedy.
She strode down the ledge, passing Stilgar without a glance, stepped down
into the crowd. A way was made for her as she headed toward Paul. And silence
followed her.
She knew the meaning of the silence -- the unspoken questions of the people,
awe of the Reverend Mother.
The young men drew back from Paul as she came up to him, and she found
herself momentarily dismayed by the new deference they paid him. "All men
beneath your position covet your station," went the Bene Gesserit axiom. But she
found no covetousness in these faces. They were held at a distance by the
religious ferment around Paul's leadership. And she recalled another Bene
Gesserit saying: "Prophets have a way of dying by violence."
Paul looked at her.
"It's time," she said, and passed the message cylinder to him.
One of Paul's companions, bolder than the others, glanced across at Stilgar,
said: "Are you going to call him out, Muad'Dib? Now's the time for sure. They'll
think you a coward if you --"
"Who dares call me coward?" Paul demanded. His hand flashed to his crysknife
hilt.
Bated silence came over the group, spreading out into the crowd.
"There's work to do," Paul said as the man drew back from him. Paul turned
away, shouldered through the crowd to the ledge, leaped lightly up to it and
faced the people.
"Do it!" someone shrieked.
Murmurs and whispers arose behind the shriek.
Paul waited for silence. It came slowly amidst scattered shufflings and
coughs. When it was quiet in the cavern, Paul lifted his chin, spoke in a voice
that carried to the farthest corners.
"You are tired of waiting," Paul said.
Again, he waited while the cries of response died out.
Indeed, they are tired of waiting, Paul thought. He hefted the message
cylinder, thinking of what it contained. His mother had showed it to him,
explaining how it had been taken from a Harkonnen courier.
The message was explicit: Rabban was being abandoned to his own resources
here on Arrakis! He could not call for help or reinforcements!
Again, Paul raised his voice: "You think it's time I called out Stilgar and
changed the leadership of the troops!" Before they could respond, Paul hurled
his voice at them in anger: "Do you think the Lisan al-Gaib that stupid?"
There was stunned silence.

He's accepting the religious mantle, Jessica thought. He must not do it!
"It's the way!" someone shouted.
Paul spoke dryly, probing the emotional undercurrents. "Ways change."
An angry voice lifted from a corner of the cavern: "We'll say what's to
change!"
There were scattered shouts of agreement through the throng.
"As you wish," Paul said.
And Jessica heard the subtle intonations as he used the powers of Voice she
had taught him.
"You will say," he agreed. "But first you will hear my say."
Stilgar moved along the ledge, his bearded face impassive. "That is the way,
too," he said. "The voice of any Fremen may be heard in Council. Paul-Muad'Dib
is a Fremen."
"The good of the tribe, that is the most important thing, eh?" Paul asked.
Still with that flat-voiced dignity, Stilgar said: "Thus our steps are
guided."
"All right," Paul said. "Then, who rules this troop of our tribe -- and who
rules all the tribes and troops through the fighting instructors we've trained
in the weirding way?"
Paul waited, looking over the heads of the throng. No answer came.
Presently, he said: "Does Stilgar rule all this? He says himself that he
does not. Do I rule? Even Stilgar does my bidding on occasion, and the sages,
the wisest of the wise, listen to me and honor me in Council."
There was shuffling silence among the crowd.
"So," Paul said. "Does my mother rule?" He pointed down to Jessica in her
black robes of office among them. "Stilgar and all the other troop leaders ask
her advice in almost every major decision. You know this. But does a Reverend
Mother walk the sand or lead a razzia against the Harkonnens?"
Frowns creased the foreheads of those Paul could see, but still there were
angry murmurs.
This is a dangerous way to do it, Jessica thought, but she remembered the
message cylinder and what it implied. And she saw Paul's intent: Go right to the
depth of their uncertainty, dispose of that, and all the rest must follow.
"No man recognizes leadership without the challenge and the combat, eh?"
Paul asked.
"That's the way!" someone shouted.
"What's our goal?" Paul asked. "To unseat Rabban, the Harkonnen beast, and
remake our world into a place where we may raise our families in happiness
amidst an abundance of water -- is this our goal?"
"Hard tasks need hard ways," someone shouted.
"Do you smash your knife before a battle?" Paul demanded. "I say this as
fact, not meaning it as boast or challenge: there isn't a man here, Stilgar
included, who could stand against me in single combat. This is Stilgar's own
admission. He knows it, so do you all."
Again, the angry mutters lifted from the crowd.
"Many of you have been with me on the practice floor," Paul said. "You know
this isn't idle boast. I say it because it's fact known to us all, and I'd be
foolish not to see it for myself. I began training in these ways earlier than
you did and my teachers were tougher than any you've ever seen. How else do you
think I bested Jamis at an age when your boys are still fighting only mock
battles?"
He's using the Voice well, Jessica thought, but that's not enough with these
people. They've good insulation against vocal control. He must catch them also
with logic.
"So," Paul said, "we come to this." He lifted the message cylinder, removed
its scrap of tape. "This was taken from a Harkonnen courier. Its authenticity is
beyond question. It is addressed to Rabban. It tells him that his request for
new troops is denied, that his spice harvest is far below quota, that he must
wring more spice from Arrakis with the people he has."
Stilgar moved up beside Paul.
"How many of you see what this means?" Paul asked. "Stilgar saw it
immediately."
"They're cut off!" someone shouted.
Paul pushed message and cylinder into his sash. From his neck he took a
braided shigawire cord and removed a ring from the cord, holding the ring aloft.
"This was my father's ducal signet," he said. "I swore never to wear it
again until I was ready to lead my troops over all of Arrakis and claim it as my
rightful fief." He put the ring on his finger, clenched his fist.
Utter stillness gripped the cavern.
"Who rules here?" Paul asked. He raised his fist. "I rule here! I rule on
every square inch of Arrakis! This is my ducal fief whether the Emperor says yea
or nay! He gave it to my father and it comes to me through my father!"
Paul lifted himself onto his toes, settled back to his heels. He studied the
crowd, feeling their temper.
Almost, he thought.
"There are men here who will hold positions of importance on Arrakis when I
claim those Imperial rights which are mine," Paul said. "Stilgar is one of those
men. Not because I wish to bribe him! Not out of gratitude, though I'm one of
many here who owe him life for life. No! But because he's wise and strong.
Because he governs this troop by his own intelligence and not just by rules. Do
you think me stupid? Do you think I'll cut off my right arm and leave it bloody
on the floor of this cavern just to provide you with a circus?"
Paul swept a hard gaze across the throng. "Who is there here to say I'm not
the rightful ruler on Arrakis? Must I prove it by leaving every Fremen tribe in
the erg without a leader?"
Beside Paul, Stilgar stirred, looked at him questioningly.
"Will I subtract from our strength when we need it most?" Paul asked. "I am
your ruler, and I say to you that it is time we stopped killing off our best men
and started killing our real enemies -- the Harkonnens!"
In one blurred motion, Stilgar had his crysknife out and pointed over the
heads of the throng. "Long live Duke Paul-Muad'Dib!" he shouted.
A deafening roar filled the cavern, echoed and re-echoed. They were cheering
and chanting: "Ya hya chouhada! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Ya hya chouhada!"
Jessica translated it to herself: "Long live the fighters of Muad'Dib!" The
scene she and Paul and Stilgar had cooked up between them had worked as they'd
planned.
The tumult died slowly.
When silence was restored, Paul faced Stilgar, said: "Kneel, Stilgar."
Stilgar dropped to his knees on the ledge.
"Hand me your crysknife," Paul said.
Stilgar obeyed.
This was not as we planned it, Jessica thought.
"Repeat after me, Stilgar," Paul said, and he called up the words of
investiture as he had heard his own father use them. "I, Stilgar, take this
knife from the hands of my Duke."
"I, Stilgar, take this knife from the hands of my Duke," Stilgar said, and
accepted the milky blade from Paul.
"Where my Duke commands, there shall I place this blade," Paul said.
Stilgar repeated the words, speaking slowly and solemnly.
Remembering the source of the rite, Jessica blinked back tears, shook her
head. I know the reasons for this, she thought. I shouldn't let it stir me.
"I dedicate this blade to the cause of my Duke and the death of his enemies
for as long as our blood shall flow," Paul said.
Stilgar repeated it after him.

"Kiss the blade," Paul ordered.
Stilgar obeyed, then, in the Fremen manner, kissed Paul's knife arm. At a
nod from Paul, he sheathed the blade, got to his feet.
A sighing whisper of awe passed through the crowd, and Jessica heard the
words: "The prophecy -- A Bene Gesserit shall show the way and a Reverend Mother
shall see it." And, from farther away: "She shows us through her son!"
"Stilgar leads this tribe," Paul said. "Let no man mistake that. He commands
with my voice. What he tells you, it is as though I told you."
Wise, Jessica thought. The tribal commander must lose no face among those
who should obey him.
Paul lowered his voice, said: "Stilgar, I want sandwalkers out this night
and cielagos sent to summon a Council Gathering. When you've sent them, bring
Chatt, Korba and Otheym and two other lieutenants of your own choosing. Bring
them to my quarters for battle planning. We must have a victory to show the
Council of Leaders when they arrive."
Paul nodded for his mother to accompany him, led the way down off the ledge
and through the throng toward the central passage and the living chambers that
had been prepared there. As Paul pressed through the crowd, hands reached out to
touch him. Voices called out to him.
"My knife goes where Stilgar commands it, Paul-Muad'Dib! Let us fight soon,
Paul-Muad'Dib! Let us wet our world with the blood of Harkonnens!"
Feeling the emotions of the throng, Jessica sensed the fighting edge of
these people. They could not be more ready. We are taking them at the crest, she
thought.
In the inner chamber, Paul motioned his mother to be seated, said: "Wait
here." And he ducked through the hangings to the side passage.
It was quiet in the chamber after Paul had gone, so quiet behind the
hangings that not even the faint soughing of the wind pumps that circulated air
in the sietch penetrated to where she sat.
He is going to bring Gurney Halleck here, she thought. And she wondered at
the strange mingling of emotions that filled her. Gurney and his music had been
a part of so many pleasant times on Caladan before the move to Arrakis. She felt
that Caladan had happened to some other person. In the nearly three years since
then, she had become another person. Having to confront Gurney forced a
reassessment of the changes.
Paul's coffee service, the fluted alloy of silver and jasmium that he had
inherited from Jamis, rested on a low table to her right. She stared at it,
thinking of how many hands had touched that metal. Chani had served Paul from it
within the month.
What can his desert woman do for a Duke except serve him coffee? she asked
herself. She brings him no power, no family. Paul has only one major chance -to ally himself with a powerful Great House, perhaps even with the Imperial
family. There are marriageable princesses, after all, and every one of them Bene
Gesserit trained.
Jessica imagined herself leaving the rigors of Arrakis for the life of power
and security she could know as mother of a royal consort. She glanced at the
thick hangings that obscured the rock of this cavern cell, thinking of how she
had come here -- riding amidst a host of worms, the palanquins and pack
platforms piled high with necessities for the coming campaign.
As long as Chani lives, Paul will not see his duty, Jessica thought. She has
given him a son and that is enough.
A sudden longing to see her grandson, the child whose likeness carried so
much of the grandfather's features -- so like Leto, swept through her. Jessica
placed her palms against her cheeks, began the ritual breathing that stilled
emotion and clarified the mind, then bent forward from the waist in the
devotional exercise that prepared the body for the mind's demands.

Paul's choice of this Cave of Birds as his command post could not be
questioned, she knew. It was ideal. And to the north lay Wind Pass opening onto
a protected village in a cliff-walled sink. It was a key village, home of
artisans and technicians, maintenance center for an entire Harkonnen defensive
sector.
A cough sounded outside the chamber hangings. Jessica straightened, took a
deep breath, exhaled slowly. "Enter," she said.
Draperies were flung aside and Gurney Halleck bounded into the room. She had
only time for a glimpse of his face with its odd grimace, then he was behind
her, lifting her to her feet with one brawny arm beneath her chin.
"Gurney, you fool, what are you doing?" she demanded.
Then she felt the touch of the knife tip against her back. Chill awareness
spread out from that knife tip. She knew in that instant that Gurney meant to
kill her. Why? She could think of no reason, for he wasn't the kind to turn
traitor. But she felt certain of his intention. Knowing it, her mind churned.
Here was no man to be overcome easily. Here was a killer wary of the Voice, wary
of every combat stratagem, wary of every trick of death and violence. Here was
an instrument she herself had helped train with subtle hints and suggestions.
"You thought you had escaped, eh, witch?" Gurney snarled.
Before she could turn the question over in her mind or try to answer, the
curtains parted and Paul entered.
"Here he is, Moth --" Paul broke off, taking in the tensions of the scene.
"You will stand where you are, m'Lord," Gurney said.
"What . . . " Paul shook his head.
Jessica started to speak, felt the arm tighten against her throat.
"You will speak only when I permit it, witch," Gurney said. "I want only one
thing from you for your son to hear it, and I am prepared to send this knife
into your heart by reflex at the first sign of a counter against me. Your voice
will remain in a monotone. Certain muscles you will not tense or move. You will
act with the most extreme caution to gain yourself a few more seconds of life.
And I assure you, these are all you have."
Paul took a step forward. "Gurney, man, what is --"
"Stop right where you are!" Gurney snapped. "One more step and she's dead."
Paul's hand slipped to his knife hilt. He spoke in a deadly quiet: "You had
best explain yourself, Gurney."
"I swore an oath to slay the betrayer of your father," Gurney said. "Do you
think I can forget the man who rescued me from a Harkonnen slave pit, gave me
freedom, life, and honor . . . gave me friendship, a thing I prized above all
else? I have his betrayer under my knife. No one can stop me from --"
"You couldn't be more wrong, Gurney," Paul said.
And Jessica thought: So that's it! What irony!
"Wrong, am I?" Gurney demanded. "Let us hear it from the woman herself. And
let her remember that I have bribed and spied and cheated to confirm this
charge. I've even pushed semuta on a Harkonnen guard captain to get part of the
story."
Jessica felt the arm at her throat ease slightly, but before she could
speak, Paul said: "The betrayer was Yueh. I tell you this once, Gurney. The
evidence is complete, cannot be controverted. It was Yueh. I do not care how you
came by your suspicion -- for it can be nothing else -- but if you harm my
mother . . . " Paul lifted his crysknife from its scabbard, held the blade in
front of him. ". . . I'll have your blood."
"Yueh was a conditioned medic, fit for a royal house," Gurney snarled. "He
could not turn traitor!"
"I know a way to remove that conditioning," Paul said.
"Evidence," Gurney insisted.
"The evidence is not here," Paul said. "It's in Tabr sietch, far to the
south, but if --"
"This is a trick," Gurney snarled, and his arm tightened on Jessica's
throat.
"No trick, Gurney," Paul said, and his voice carried such a note of terrible
sadness that the sound tore at Jessica's heart.
"I saw the message captured from the Harkonnen agent," Gurney said. "The
note pointed directly at --"
"I saw it, too," Paul said. "My father showed it to me the night he
explained why it had to be a Harkonnen trick aimed at making him suspect the
woman he loved."
"Ayah!" Gurney said. "You've not --"
"Be quiet," Paul said, and the monotone stillness of his words carried more
command than Jessica had ever heard in another voice.
He has the Great Control, she thought.
Gurney's arm trembled against her neck. The point of the knife at her back
moved with uncertainty.
"What you have not done," Paul said, "is heard my mother sobbing in the
night over her lost Duke. You have not seen her eyes stab flame when she speaks
of killing Harkonnens."
So he has listened, she thought. Tears blinded her eyes.
"What you have not done," Paul went on, "is remembered the lessons you
learned in a Harkonnen slave pit. You speak of pride in my father's friendship!
Didn't you learn the difference between Harkonnen and Atreides so that you could
smell a Harkonnen trick by the stink they left on it? Didn't you learn that
Atreides loyalty is bought with love while the Harkonnen coin is hate? Couldn't
you see through to the very nature of this betrayal?"
"But Yueh?" Gurney muttered.
"The evidence we have is Yueh's own message to us admitting his treachery,"
Paul said. "I swear this to you by the love I hold for you, a love I will still
hold even after I leave you dead on this floor."
Hearing her son, Jessica marveled at the awareness in him, the penetrating
insight of his intelligence.
"My father had an instinct for his friends," Paul said. "He gave his love
sparingly, but with never an error. His weakness lay in misunderstanding hatred.
He thought anyone who hated Harkonnens could not betray him." He glanced at his
mother. "She knows this. I've given her my father's message that he never
distrusted her."
Jessica felt herself losing control, bit at her lower lip. Seeing the stiff
formality in Paul, she realized what these words were costing him. She wanted to
run to him, cradle his head against her breast as she never had done. But the
arm against her throat had ceased its trembling; the knifepoint at her back
pressed still and sharp.
"One of the most terrible moments in a boy's life," Paul said, "is when he
discovers his father and mother are human beings who share a love that he can
never quite taste. It's a loss, an awakening to the fact that the world is there
and here and we are in it alone. The moment carries its own truth; you can't
evade it. I heard my father when he spoke of my mother. She's not the betrayer,
Gurney."
Jessica found her voice, said: "Gurney, release me." There was no special
command in the words, no trick to play on his weaknesses, but Gurney's hand fell
away. She crossed to Paul, stood in front of him, not touching him.
"Paul," she said, "there are other awakenings in this universe. I suddenly
see how I've used you and twisted you and manipulated you to set you on a course
of my choosing . . . a course I had to choose -- if that's any excuse -- because
of my own training." She swallowed past a lump in her throat, looked up into her
son's eyes. "Paul . . . I want you to do something for me: choose the course of
happiness. Your desert woman, marry her if that's your wish. Defy everyone and
everything to do this. But choose your own course. I . . . "
She broke off, stopped by the low sound of muttering behind her.
Gurney!
She saw Paul's eyes directed beyond her, turned.
Gurney stood in the same spot, but had sheathed his knife, pulled the robe
away from his breast to expose the slick grayness of an issue stillsuit, the
type the smugglers traded for among the sietch warrens.
"Put your knife right here in my breast," Gurney muttered. "I say kill me
and have done with it. I've besmirched my name. I've betrayed my own Duke! The
finest --"
"Be still!" Paul said.
Gurney stared at him.
"Close that robe and stop acting like a fool," Paul said. "I've had enough
foolishness for one day."
"Kill me, I say!" Gurney raged.
"You know me better than that," Paul said. "How many kinds of an idiot do
you think I am? Must I go through this with every man I need?"
Gurney looked at Jessica, spoke in a forlorn, pleading note so unlike him:
"Then you, my Lady, please . . . you kill me."
Jessica crossed to him, put her hands on his shoulders. "Gurney, why do you
insist the Atreides must kill those they love?" Gently, she pulled the spread
robe out of his fingers, closed and fastened the fabric over his chest.
Gurney spoke brokenly; "But . . . I . . . "
"You thought you were doing a thing for Leto," she said, "and for this I
honor you."
"My Lady," Gurney said. He dropped his chin to his chest, squeezed his
eyelids closed against the tears.
"Let us think of this as a misunderstanding among old friends," she said,
and Paul heard the soothers, the adjusting tones in her voice. "It's over and we
can be thankful we'll never again have that sort of misunderstanding between
us."
Gurney opened eyes bright with moisture, looked down at her.
"The Gurney Halleck I knew was a man adept with both blade and baliset,"
Jessica said. "It was the man of the baliset I most admired. Doesn't that Gurney
Halleck remember how I used to enjoy listening by the hour while he played for
me? Do you still have a baliset, Gurney?"
"I've a new one," Gurney said. "Brought from Chusuk, a sweet instrument.
Plays like a genuine Varota, though there's no signature on it. I think myself
it was made by a student of Varota's who . . ." He broke off. "What can I say to
you, my Lady? Here we prattle about --"
"Not prattle, Gurney," Paul said. He crossed to stand beside his mother, eye
to eye with Gurney. "Not prattle, but a thing that brings happiness between
friends. I'd take it a kindness if you'd play for her now. Battle planning can
wait a little while. We'll not be going into the fight till tomorrow at any
rate."
"I . . . I'll get my baliset," Gurney said. "It's in the passage." He
stepped around them and through the hangings.
Paul put a hand on his mother's arm, found that she was trembling.
"It's over, Mother," he said.
Without turning her head, she looked up at him from the corners of her eyes.
"Over?"
"Of course. Gurney's . . . "
"Gurney? Oh . . . yes." She lowered her gaze.
The hangings rustled as Gurney returned with his baliset. He began tuning
it, avoiding their eyes. The hangings on the walls dulled the echoes, making the
instrument sound small and intimate.
Paul led his mother to a cushion, seated her there with her back to the
thick draperies of the wall. He was suddenly struck by how old she seemed to him
with the beginnings of desert-dried lines in her face, the stretching at the
corners of her blue-veiled eyes.
She's tired, he thought. We must find some way to ease her burdens.
Gurney strummed a chord.
Paul glanced at him, said: "I've . . . things that need my attention. Wait
here for me."
Gurney nodded. His mind seemed far away, as though he dwelled for this
moment beneath the open skies of Caladan with cloud fleece on the horizon
promising rain.
Paul forced himself to turn away, let himself out through the heavy hangings
over the side passage. He heard Gurney take up a tune behind him, and paused a
moment outside the room to listen to the muted music.
"Orchards and vineyards,
And full-breasted houris,
And a cup overflowing before me.
Why do I babble of battles,
And mountains reduced to dust?
Why do I feel these tears?
Heavens stand open
And scatter their riches;
My hands need but gather their wealth.
Why do I think of an ambush,
And poison in molten cup?
Why do I feel my years?
Love's arms beckon
With their naked delights,
And Eden's promise of ecstasies.
Why do I remember the scars,
Dream of old transgressions . . .
And why do I sleep with fears?"
A robed Fedaykin courier appeared from a corner of the passage ahead of
Paul. The man had hood thrown back and fastenings of his stillsuit hanging loose
about his neck, proof that he had come just now from the open desert.
Paul motioned for him to stop, left the hangings of the door and moved down
the passage to the courier.
The man bowed, hands clasped in front of him the way he might greet a
Reverend Mother or Sayyadina of the rites. He said: "Muad'Dib, leaders are
beginning to arrive for the Council."
"So soon?"
"These are the ones Stilgar sent for earlier when it was thought . . ." He
shrugged.
"I see." Paul glanced back toward the faint sound of the baliset, thinking
of the old song that his mother favored -- an odd stretching of happy tune and
sad words. "Stilgar will come here soon with others. Show them where my mother
waits."
"I will wait here, Muad'Dib," the courier said.
"Yes . . . yes, do that."
Paul pressed past the man toward the depths of the cavern, headed for the
place that each such cavern had -- a place near its water-holding basin. There
would be a small shai-hulud in this place, a creature no more than nine meters
long, kept stunted and trapped by surrounding water ditches. The maker, after
emerging from its little maker vector, avoided water for the poison it was. And
the drowning of a maker was the greatest Fremen secret because it produced the
substance of their union -- the Water of Life, the poison that could only be
changed by a Reverend Mother.
The decision had come to Paul while he faced the tension of danger to his
mother. No line of the future he had ever seen carried that moment, of peril
from Gurney Halleck. The future -- the gray-cloud-future -- with its feeling
that the entire universe rolled toward a boiling nexus hung around him like a
phantom world.
I must see it, he thought.
His body had slowly acquired a certain spice tolerance that made prescient
visions fewer and fewer . . . dimmer and dimmer. The solution appeared obvious
to him.
I will drown the maker. We will see now whether I'm the Kwisatz Haderach who
can survive the test that the Reverend Mothers have survived.

And it came to pass in the third year of the Desert War that Paul-Muad'Dib lay
alone in the Cave of Birds beneath the kiswa hangings of an inner cell. And he
lay as one dead, caught up in the revelation of the Water of Life, his being
translated beyond the boundaries of time by the poison that gives life. Thus was
the prophecy made true that the Lisan al-Gaib might be both dead and alive.
-"Collected Legends of Arrakis" by the Princess Irulan
Chani came up out of the Habbanya basin in the predawn darkness, hearing the
'thopter that had brought her from the south go whir-whirring off to a hiding
place in the vastness. Around her, the escort kept its distance, fanning out
into the rocks of the ridge to probe for dangers -- and giving the mate of
Muad'Dib, the mother of his firstborn, the thing she had requested: a moment to
walk alone.
Why did he summon me? she asked herself. He told me before that I must
remain in the south with little Leto and Alia.
She gathered her robe and leaped lightly up across a barrier rock and onto
the climbing path that only the desert-trained could recognize in the darkness.
Pebbles slithered underfoot and she danced across them without considering the
nimbleness required.
The climb was exhilarating, easing the fears that had fermented in her
because of her escort's silent withdrawal and the fact that a precious 'thopter
had been sent for her. She felt the inner leaping at the nearness of reunion
with Paul-Muad'Dib, her Usul. His name might be a battle cry over all the land:
"Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib! Muad'Dib!" But she knew a different man by a different name
-- the father of her son, the tender lover.
A great figure loomed out of the rocks above her, beckoning for speed. She
quickened her pace. Dawn birds already were calling and lifting into the sky. A
dim spread of light grew across the eastern horizon.
The figure above was not one of her own escort. Otheym? she wondered,
marking a familiarity of movement and manner. She came up to him, recognized in
the growing light the broad, flat features of the Fedaykin lieutenant, his hood
open and mouth filter loosely fastened the way one did sometimes when venturing
out on the desert for only a moment.
"Hurry," he hissed, and led her down the secret crevasse into the hidden
cave. "It will be light soon," he whispered as he held a doorseal open for her.
"The Harkonnens have been making desperation patrols over some of this region.
We dare not chance discovery now."
They emerged into the narrow side-passage entrance to the Cave of Birds.
Glowglobes came alight. Otheym pressed past her, said: "Follow me. Quickly,
now."
They sped down the passage, through another valve door, another passage and
through hangings into what had been the Sayyadina's alcove in the days when this
was an overday rest cave. Rugs and cushions now covered the floor. Woven
hangings with the red figure of a hawk hid the rock walls. A low field desk at
one side was strewn with papers from which lifted the aroma of their spice
origin.
The Reverend Mother sat alone directly opposite the entrance. She looked up
with the inward stare that made the uninitiated tremble.
Otheym pressed palms together, said: "I have brought Chani." He bowed,
retreated through the hangings.
And Jessica thought: How do I tell Chani?
"How is my grandson?" Jessica asked.
So it's to be the ritual greeting, Chani thought, and her fears returned.
Where is Muad'Dib? Why isn't he here to greet me?
"He is healthy and happy, my mother," Chani said. "I left him with Alia in
the care of Harah."
My mother, Jessica thought. Yes, she has the right to call me that in the
formal greeting. She has given me a grandson.
"I hear a gift of cloth has been sent from Coanua sietch," Jessica said.
"It is lovely cloth," Chani said.
"Does Alia send a message?"
"No message. But the sietch moves more smoothly now that the people are
beginning to accept the miracle of her status."
Why does she drag this out so? Chani wondered. Something was so urgent that
they sent a 'thopter for me. Now, we drag through the formalities!
"We must have some of the new cloth cut into garments for little Leto,"
Jessica said.
"Whatever you wish, my mother," Chani said. She lowered her gaze. "Is there
news of battles?" She held her face expressionless that Jessica might not see
the betrayal -- that this was a question about Paul Muad'Dib.
"New victories," Jessica said. "Rabban has sent cautious overtures about a
truce. His messengers have been returned without their water. Rabban has even
lightened the burdens of the people in some of the sink villages. But he is too
late. "The people know he does it out of fear of us."
"Thus it goes as Muad'Dib said," Chani said. She stared at Jessica, trying
to keep her fears to herself. I have spoken his name, but she has not responded.
One cannot see emotion in that glazed stone she calls a face . . . but she is
too frozen. Why is she so still? What has happened to my Usul?
"I wish we were in the south," Jessica said. "The oases were so beautiful
when we left. Do you not long for the day when the whole land may blossom thus?"
"The land is beautiful, true," Chani said. "But there is much grief in it."
"Grief is the price of victory," Jessica said.
Is she preparing me for grief? Chani asked herself. She said: "There are so
many women without men. There was jealousy when it was learned that I'd been
summoned north."
"I summoned you," Jessica said.
Chani felt her heart hammering. She wanted to clap her hands to her ears,
fearful of what they might hear. Still, she kept her voice even: "The message
was signed Muad'Dib."
"I signed it thus in the presence of his lieutenants," Jessica said. "It was
a subterfuge of necessity." And Jessica thought: This is a brave woman, my
Paul's. She holds to the niceties even when fear is almost overwhelming her.
Yes. She may be the one we need now.
Only the slightest tone of resignation crept into Chani's voice as she said:
"Now you may say the thing that must be said."
"You were needed here to help me revive Paul," Jessica said. And she
thought: There! I said it in the precisely correct way. Revive. Thus she knows
Paul is alive and knows there is peril, all in the same word.
Chani took only a moment to calm herself, then: "What is it I may do?" She
wanted to leap at Jessica, shake her and scream: "Take me to him!" But she
waited silently for the answer.
"I suspect," Jessica said, "that the Harkonnens have managed to send an
agent among us to poison Paul. It's the only explanation that seems to fit. A
most unusual poison. I've examined his blood in the most subtle ways without
detecting it."
Chani thrust herself forward onto her knees. "Poison? Is he in pain? Could I
. . . "
"He is unconscious," Jessica said. "The processes of his life are so low
that they can be detected only with the most refined techniques. I shudder to
think what could have happened had I not been the one to discover him. He
appears dead to the untrained eye."
"You have reasons other than courtesy for summoning me," Chani said. "I know
you, Reverend Mother. What is it you think I may do that you cannot do?"
She is brave, lovely and, ah-h-h, so perceptive, Jessica thought. She'd have
made a fine Bene Gesserit.
"Chani," Jessica said, "you may find this difficult to believe, but I do not
know precisely why I sent for you. It was an instinct . . . a basic intuition.
The thought came unbidden: 'Send for Chani.' "
For the first time, Chani saw the sadness in Jessica's expression, the
unveiled pain modifying the inward stare.
"I've done all I know to do," Jessica said. "That all . . . it is so far
beyond what is usually supposed as all that you would find difficulty imagining
it. Yet . . . I failed."
"The old companion, Halleck," Chani asked, "is it possible he's a traitor?"
"Not Gurney," Jessica said.
The two words carried an entire conversation, and Chani saw the searching,
the tests . . . the memories of old failures that went into this flat denial.
Chani rocked back onto her feet, stood up, smoothed her desert-stained robe.
"Take me to him," she said.
Jessica arose, turned through hangings on the left wall.
Chani followed, found herself in what had been a storeroom, its rock walls
concealed now beneath heavy draperies. Paul lay on a field pad against the far
wall. A single glowglobe above him illuminated his face. A black robe covered
him to the chest, leaving his arms outside it stretched along his sides. He
appeared to be unclothed under the robe. The skin exposed looked waxen, rigid.
There was no visible movement to him.
Chani suppressed the desire to dash forward, throw herself across him. She
found her thoughts, instead, going to her son -- Leto. And she realized in this
instant that Jessica once had faced such a moment -- her man threatened by
death, forced in her own mind to consider what might be done to save a young
son. The realization formed a sudden bond with the older woman so that Chani
reached out and clasped Jessica's hand. The answering grip was painful in its
intensity.
"He lives," Jessica said. "I assure you he lives. But the thread of his life
is so thin it could easily escape detection. There are some among the leaders
already muttering that the mother speaks and not the Reverend Mother, that my
son is truly dead and I do not want to give up his water to the tribe."
"How long has he been this way?" Chani asked. She disengaged her hand from
Jessica's, moved farther into the room.
"Three weeks," Jessica said. "I spent almost a week trying to revive him.
There were meetings, arguments . . . investigations. Then I sent for you. The
Fedaykin obey my orders, else I might not have been able to delay the . . . "
She wet her lips with her tongue, watching Chani cross to Paul.
Chani stood over him now, looking down on the soft beard of youth that
framed his face, tracing with her eyes the high browline, the strong nose, the
shuttered eyes -- the features so peaceful in this rigid repose.
"How does he take nourishment?" Chani asked.
"The demands of his flesh are so slight he does not yet need food," Jessica
said.
"How many know of what has happened?" Chani asked.
"Only his closest advisers, a few of the leaders, the Fedaykin and, of
course, whoever administered the poison."
"There is no clue to the poisoner?"
"And it's not for want of investigating," Jessica said.
"What do the Fedaykin say?" Chani asked.
"They believe Paul is in a sacred trance, gathering his holy powers before
the final battles. This is a thought I've cultivated."
Chani lowered herself to her knees beside the pad, bent close to Paul's
face. She sensed an immediate difference in the air about his face . . . but it
was only the spice, the ubiquitous spice whose odor permeated everything in
Fremen life. Still . . .
"You were not born to the spice as we were," Chani said. "Have you
investigated the possibility that his body has rebelled against too much spice
in his diet?"
"Allergy reactions are all negative," Jessica said.
She closed her eyes, as much to blot out this scene as because of sudden
realization of fatigue. How long have I been without sleep? she asked herself.
Too long.
"When you change the Water of Life," Chani said, "you do it within yourself
by the inward awareness. Have you used this awareness to test his blood?"
"Normal Fremen blood," Jessica said. "Completely adapted to the diet and the
life here."
Chani sat back on her heels, submerging her fears in thought as she studied
Paul's face. This was a trick she had learned from watching the Reverend
Mothers. Time could be made to serve the mind. One concentrated the entire
attention.
Presently, Chani said: "Is there a maker here?"
"There are several," Jessica said with a touch of weariness. "We are never
without them these days. Each victory requires its blessing. Each ceremony
before a raid --"
"But Paul Muad'Dib has held himself aloof from these ceremonies," Chani
said.
Jessica nodded to herself, remembering her son's ambivalent feelings toward
the spice drug and the prescient awareness it precipitated.
"How did you know this?" Jessica asked.
"It is spoken."
"Too much is spoken," Jessica said bitterly.
"Get me the raw Water of the maker," Chani said.
Jessica stiffened at the tone of command in Chani's voice, then observed the
intense concentration in the younger woman and said: "At once." She went out
through the hangings to send a waterman.
Chani sat staring at Paul. If he has tried to do this, she thought. And it's
the sort of thing he might try . . .
Jessica knelt beside Chani, holding out a plain camp ewer. The charged odor
of the poison was sharp in Chani's nostrils. She dipped a finger in the fluid,
held the finger close to Paul's nose.
The skin along the bridge of his nose wrinkled slightly. Slowly, the
nostrils flared.

Jessica gasped.
Chani touched the dampened finger to Paul's upper lip.
He drew in a long, sobbing breath. "What is this?" Jessica demanded.
"Be still," Chani said. "You must convert a small amount of the sacred
water. Quickly!"
Without questioning, because she recognized the tone of awareness in Chani's
voice, Jessica lifted the ewer to her mouth, drew in a small sip.
Paul's eyes flew open. He stared upward at Chani.
"It is not necessary for her to change the Water," he said. His voice was
weak, but steady.
Jessica, a sip of the fluid on her tongue, found her body rallying,
converting the poison almost automatically. In the light elevation the ceremony
always imparted, she sensed the life-glow from Paul -- a radiation there
registering on her senses.
In that instant, she knew.
"You drank the sacred water!" she blurted.
"One drop of it," Paul said. "So small . . . one drop."
"How could you do such a foolish thing?" she demanded.
"He is your son," Chani said.
Jessica glared at her.
A rare smile, warm and full of understanding, touched Paul's lips. "Hear my
beloved," he said. "Listen to her, Mother. She knows."
"A thing that others can do, he must do," Chani said.
"When I had the drop in my mouth, when I felt it and smelled it, when I knew
what it was doing to me, then I knew I could do the thing that you have done,"
he said. "Your Bene Gesserit proctors speak of the Kwisatz Haderach, but they
cannot begin to guess the many places I have been. In the few minutes I . . . "
He broke off, looking at Chani with a puzzled frown. "Chani? How did you get
here? You're supposed to be . . . Why are you here?"
He tried to push himself onto his elbows. Chani pressed him back gently.
"Please, my Usul," she said.
"I feel so weak," he said. His gaze darted around the room. "How long have I
been here?"
"You've been three weeks in a coma so deep that the spark of life seemed to
have fled," Jessica said.
"But it was . . . I took it just a moment ago and . . . "
"A moment for you, three weeks of fear for me," Jessica said.
"It was only one drop, but I converted it," Paul said. "I changed the Water
of Life." And before Chani or Jessica could stop him, he dipped his hand into
the ewer they had placed on the floor beside him, and he brought the dripping
hand to his mouth, swallowed the palm-cupped liquid.
"Paul!" Jessica screamed.
He grabbed her hand, faced her with a death's head grin, and he sent his
awareness surging over her.
The rapport was not as tender, not as sharing, not as encompassing as it had
been with Alia and with the Old Reverend Mother in the cavern . . . but it was a
rapport: a sense-sharing of the entire being. It shook her, weakened her, and
she cowered in her mind, fearful of him.
Aloud, he said: "You speak of a place where you cannot enter? This place
which the Reverend Mother cannot face, show it to me."
She shook her head, terrified by the very thought.
"Show it to me!" he commanded.
"No!"
But she could not escape him. Bludgeoned by the terrible force of him, she
closed her eyes and focused inward -- the-direction-that-is-dark.
Paul's consciousness flowed through and around her and into the darkness.
She glimpsed the place dimly before her mind blanked itself away from the
terror. Without knowing why, her whole being trembled at what she had seen -- a
region where a wind blew and sparks glared, where rings of light expanded and
contracted, where rows of tumescent white shapes flowed over and under and
around the lights, driven by darkness and a wind out of nowhere.
Presently, she opened her eyes, saw Paul staring up at her. He still held
her hand, but the terrible rapport was gone. She quieted her trembling. Paul
released her hand. It was as though some crutch had been removed. She staggered
up and back, would have fallen had not Chani jumped to support her.
"Reverend Mother!" Chani said. "What is wrong?"
"Tired," Jessica whispered. "So . . . tired."
"Here," Chani said. "Sit here." She helped Jessica to a cushion against the
wall.
The strong young arms felt so good to Jessica. She clung to Chani.
"He has, in truth, seen the Water of Life?" Chani asked. She disengaged
herself from Jessica's grip.
"He has seen," Jessica whispered. Her mind still rolled and surged from the
contact. It was like stepping to solid land after weeks on a heaving sea. She
sensed the old Reverend Mother within her . . . and all the others awakened and
questioning; "What was that? What happened? Where was that place?"
Through it all threaded the realization that her son was the Kwisatz
Haderach, the one who could be many places at once. He was the fact out of the
Bene Gesserit dream. And the fact gave her no peace.
"What happened?" Chani demanded.
Jessica shook her head.
Paul said: "There is in each of us an ancient force that takes and an
ancient force that gives. A man finds little difficulty facing that place within
himself where the taking force dwells, but it's almost impossible for him to see
into the giving force without changing into something other than man. For a
woman, the situation is reversed."
Jessica looked up, found Chani was staring at her while listening to Paul.
"Do you understand me, Mother?" Paul asked.
She could only nod.
"These things are so ancient within us," Paul said, "that they're ground
into each separate cell of our bodies. We're shaped by such forces. You can say
to yourself, 'Yes, I see how such a thing may be.' But when you look inward and
confront the raw force of your own life unshielded, you see your peril. You see
that this could overwhelm you. The greatest peril to the Giver is the force that
takes. The greatest peril to the Taker is the force that gives. It's as easy to
be overwhelmed by giving as by taking."
"And you, my son," Jessica asked, "are you one who gives or one who takes?"
"I'm at the fulcrum," he said. "I cannot give without taking and I cannot
take without . . . " He broke off, looking to the wall at his right.
Chani felt a draft against her cheek, turned to see the hangings close.
"It was Otheym," Paul said. "He was listening."
Accepting the words, Chani was touched by some of the prescience that
haunted Paul, and she knew a thing-yet-to-be as though it already had occurred.
Otheym would speak of what he had seen and heard. Others would spread the story
until it was a fire over the land. Paul-Muad'Dib is not as other men, they would
say. There can be no more doubt. He is a man, yet he sees through to the Water
of Life in the way of a Reverend Mother. He is indeed the Lisan al-Gaib.
"You have seen the future, Paul," Jessica said. "Will you say what you've
seen?"
"Not the future," he said. "I've seen the Now." He forced himself to a
sitting position, waved Chani aside as she moved to help him. "The Space above
Arrakis is filled with the ships of the Guild."
Jessica trembled at the certainty in his voice.

"The Padishah Emperor himself is there," Paul said. He looked at the rock
ceiling of his cell. "With his favorite Truthsayer and five legions of
Sardaukar. The old Baron Vladimir Harkonnen is there with Thufir Hawat beside
him and seven ships jammed with every conscript he could muster. Every Great
House has its raiders above us . . . waiting."
Chani shook her head, unable to look away from Paul. His strangeness, the
flat tone of voice, the way he looked through her, filled her with awe.
Jessica tried to swallow in a dry throat, said: "For what are they waiting?"
Paul looked at her. "For the Guild's permission to land. The Guild will
strand on Arrakis any force that lands without permission."
"The Guild's protecting us?" Jessica asked.
"Protecting us! The Guild itself caused this by spreading tales about what
we do here and by reducing troop transport fares to a point where even the
poorest Houses are up there now waiting to loot us."
Jessica noted the lack of bitterness in his tone, wondered at it. She
couldn't doubt his words -- they had that same intensity she'd seen in him the
night he'd revealed the path of the future that'd taken them among the Fremen.
Paul took a deep breath, said: "Mother, you must change a quantity of the
Water for us. We need the catalyst. Chani, have a scout force sent out . . . to
find a pre-spice mass. If we plant a quantity of the Water of Life above a prespice mass, do you know what will happen?"
Jessica weighed his words, suddenly saw through to his meaning. "Paul!" she
gasped.
"The Water of Death," he said. "It'd be a chain reaction." He pointed to the
floor. "Spreading death among the little makers, killing a vector of the life
cycle that includes the spice and the makers. Arrakis will become a true
desolation -- without spice or maker."
Chani put a hand to her mouth, shocked to numb silence by the blasphemy
pouring from Paul's lips.
"He who can destroy a thing has the real control of it," Paul said. "We can
destroy the spice."
"What stays the Guild's hand?" Jessica whispered.
"They're searching for me," Paul said. "Think of that! The finest Guild
navigators, men who can quest ahead through time to find the safest course for
the fastest Heighliners, all of them seeking me . . .and unable to find me. How
they tremble! They know I have their secret here!" Paul held out his cupped
hand. "Without the spice they're blind!"
Chani found her voice. "You said you see the now!"
Paul lay back, searching the spread-out present, its limits extended into
the future and into the past, holding onto the awareness with difficulty as the
spice illumination began to fade.
"Go do as I commanded," he said. "The future's becoming as muddled for the
Guild as it is for me. The lines of vision are narrowing. Everything focuses
here where the spice is . . . where they've dared not interfere before . . .
because to interfere was to lose what they must have. But now they're desperate.
All paths lead into darkness."

And that day dawned when Arrakis lay at the hub of the universe with the wheel
poised to spin.
-from "Arrakis Awakening" by the Princess Irulan
"Will you look at that thing!" Stilgar whispered.
Paul lay beside him in a slit of rock high on the Shield Wall rim, eye fixed
to the collector of a Fremen telescope. The oil lens was focused on a starship
lighter exposed by dawn in the basin below them. The tall eastern face of the
ship glistened in the flat light of the sun, but the shadow side still showed
yellow portholes from glowglobes of the night. Beyond the ship, the city of
Arrakeen lay cold and gleaming in the light of the northern sun.
It wasn't the lighter that excited Stilgar's awe, Paul knew, but the
construction for which the lighter was only the centerpost. A single metal
hutment, many stories tall, reached out in a thousand-meter circle from the base
of the lighter -- a tent composed of interlocking metal leaves -- the temporary
lodging place for five legions of Sardaukar and His Imperial Majesty, the
Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV.
From his position squatting at Paul's left, Gurney Halleck said: "I count
nine levels to it. Must be quite a few Sardaukar in there."
"Five legions," Paul said.
"It grows light," Stilgar hissed. "We like it not, your exposing yourself,
Muad'Dib. Let us go back into the rocks now."
"I'm perfectly safe here," Paul said.
"That ship mounts projectile weapons," Gurney said.
"They believe us protected by shields," Paul said. "They wouldn't waste a
shot on an unidentified trio even if they saw us."
Paul swung the telescope to scan the far wall of the basin, seeing the
pockmarked cliffs, the slides that marked the tombs of so many of his father's
troopers. And he had a momentary sense of the fitness of things that the shades
of those men should look down on this moment. The Harkonnen forts and towns
across the shielded lands lay in Fremen hands or cut away from their source like
stalks severed from a plant and left to wither. Only this basin and its city
remained to the enemy.
"They might try a sortie by 'thopter," Stilgar said. "If they see us."
"Let them," Paul said. "We've 'thopters to burn today . . . and we know a
storm is coming."
He swung the telescope to the far side of the Arrakeen landing field now, to
the Harkonnen frigates lined up there with a CHOAM Company banner waving gently
from its staff on the ground beneath them. And he thought of the desperation
that had forced the Guild to permit these two groups to land while all the
others were held in reserve. The Guild was like a man testing the sand with his
toe to gauge its temperature before erecting a tent.
"Is there anything new to see from here?" Gurney asked. "We should be
getting under cover. The storm is coming."
Paul returned his attention on the giant hutment. "They've even brought
their women," he said. "And lackeys and servants. Ah-h-h, my dear Emperor, how
confident you are."
"Men are coming up the secret way," Stilgar said. "It may be Otheym and
Korba returning."
"All right, Stil," Paul said. "We'll go back."
But he took one final look around through the telescope -- studying the
plain with its tall ships, the gleaming metal hutment, the silent city, the
frigates of the Harkonnen mercenaries. Then he slid backward around a scarp of
rock. His place at the telescope was taken by a Fedaykin guardsman.
Paul emerged into a shallow depression in the Shield Wall's surface. It was
a place about thirty meters in diameter and some three meters deep, a natural
feature of the rock that the Fremen had hidden beneath a translucent camouflage
cover. Communications equipment was clustered around a hole in the wall to the
right. Fedaykin guards deployed through the depression waited for Muad'Dib's
command to attack.
Two men emerged from the hole by the communications equipment, spoke to the
guards there.
Paul glanced at Stilgar, nodded in the direction of the two men. "Get their
report, Stil."
Stilgar moved to obey.

Paul crouched with his back to the rock, stretching his muscles,
straightened. He saw Stilgar sending the two men back into that dark hole in the
rock, thought about the long climb down that narrow man-made tunnel to the floor
of the basin.
Stilgar crossed to Paul.
"What was so important that they couldn't send a cielago with the message?"
Paul asked.
"They're saving their birds for the battle," Stilgar said. He glanced at the
communications equipment, back to Paul. "Even with a tight beam, it is wrong to
use those things, Muad'Dib. They can find you by taking a bearing on its
emission."
"They'll soon be too busy to find me," Paul said. "What did the men report?"
"Our pet Sardaukar have been released near Old Gap low on the rim and are on
their way to their master. The rocket launchers and other projectile weapons are
in place. The people are deployed as you ordered. It was all routine."
Paul glanced across the shallow bowl, studying his men in the filtered light
admitted by the camouflage cover. He felt time creeping like an insect working
its way across an exposed rock.
"It'll take our Sardaukar a little time afoot before they can signal a troop
carrier," Paul said.
"They are being watched?"
"They are being watched," Stilgar said.
Beside Paul, Gurney Halleck cleared his throat. "Hadn't we best be getting
to a place of safety?"
"There is no such place," Paul said. "Is the weather report still
favorable?"
"A great grandmother of a storm coming," Stilgar said. "Can you not feel it,
Muad'Dib?"
"The air does feel chancy," Paul agreed. "But I like the certainty of poling
the weather."
"The storm'll be here in the hour," Stilgar said. He nodded toward the gap
that looked out on the Emperor's hutment and the Harkonnen frigates. "They know
it there, too. Not a 'thopter in the sky. Everything pulled in and tied down.
They've had a report on the weather from their friends in space."
"Any more probing sorties?" Paul asked.
"Nothing since the landing last night," Stilgar said. "They know we're here.
I think now they wait to choose their own time."
"We choose the time," Paul said.
Gurney glanced upward, growled: "If they let us."
"That fleet'll stay in space," Paul said.
Gurney shook his head.
"They have no choice," Paul said. "We can destroy the spice. The Guild dares
not risk that."
"Desperate people are the most dangerous," Gurney said.
"Are we not desperate?" Stilgar asked.
Gurney scowled at him.
"You haven't lived with the Fremen dream," Paul cautioned. "Stil is thinking
of all the water we've spent on bribes, the years of waiting we've added before
Arrakis can bloom. He's not --"
"Arrrgh," Gurney scowled.
"Why's he so gloomy?" Stilgar asked.
"He's always gloomy before a battle," Paul said. "It's the only form of good
humor Gurney allows himself."
A slow, wolfish grin spread across Gurney's face, the teeth showing white
above the chip cup of his stillsuit. "It glooms me much to think on all the poor
Harkonnen souls we'll dispatch unshriven," he said.
Stilgar chuckled. "He talks like a Fedaykin."
"Gurney was born a death commando," Paul said. And he thought: Yes, let them
occupy their minds with small talk be fore we test ourselves against that force
on the plain. He looked to the gap in the rock wall and back to Gurney, found
that the troubadour-warrior had resumed a brooding scowl.
"Worry saps the strength," Paul murmured. "You told me that once, Gurney."
"My Duke," Gurney said, "my chief worry is the atomics. If you use them to
blast a hole in the Shield Wall . . . "
"Those people up there won't use atomics against us," Paul said. "They don't
dare . . . and for the same reason that they cannot risk our destroying the
source of the spice."
"But the injunction against --"
"The injunction!" Paul barked. "It's fear, not the injunction that keeps the
Houses from hurling atomics against each other. The language of the Great
Convention is clear enough: 'Use of atomics against humans shall be cause for
planetary obliteration.' We're going to blast the Shield Wall, not humans."
"It's too fine a point," Gurney said.
"The hair-splitters up there will welcome any point," Paul said. "Let's talk
no more about it."
He turned away, wishing he actually felt that confident. Presently, he said:
"What about the city people? Are they in position yet?"
"Yes," Stilgar muttered.
Paul looked at him. "What's eating you?"
"I never knew the city man could be trusted completely," Stilgar said.
"I was a city man myself once," Paul said.
Stilgar stiffened. His face grew dark with blood. "Muad'Dib knows I did not
mean --"
"I know what you meant, Stil. But the test of a man isn't what you think
he'll do. It's what he actually does. These city people have Fremen blood. It's
just that they haven't yet learned how to escape their bondage. We'll teach
them."
Stilgar nodded, spoke in a rueful tone: "The habits of a lifetime, Muad'Dib.
On the Funeral Plain we learned to despise the men of the communities."
Paul glanced at Gurney, saw him studying Stilgar. "Tell us, Gurney, why were
the city folk down there driven from their homes by the Sardaukar?"
"An old trick, my Duke. They thought to burden us with refugees."
"It's been so long since guerrillas were effective that the mighty have
forgotten how to fight them," Paul said. "The Sardaukar have played into our
hands. They grabbed some city women for their sport, decorated their battle
standards with the heads of the men who objected. And they've built up a fever
of hate among people who otherwise would've looked on the coming battle as no
more than a great inconvenience . . . and the possibility of exchanging one set
of masters for another. The Sardaukar recruit for us, Stilgar."
"The city people do seem eager," Stilgar said.
"Their hate is fresh and clear," Paul said. "That's why we use them as shock
troops."
"The slaughter among them will be fearful," Gurney said.
Stilgar nodded agreement.
"They were told the odds," Paul said. "They know every Sardaukar they kill
will be one less for us. You see, gentlemen, they have something to die for.
They've discovered they're a people. They're awakening."
A muttered exclamation came from the watcher at the telescope. Paul moved to
the rock slit, asked: "What is it out there?"
"A great commotion, Muad'Dib," the watcher hissed. "At that monstrous metal
tent. A surface car came from Rimwall West and it was like a hawk into a nest of
rock partridge."
"Our captive Sardaukar have arrived," Paul said.

"They've a shield around the entire landing field now," the watcher said. "I
can see the air dancing even to the edge of the storage yard where they kept the
spice."
"Now they know who it is they fight," Gurney said. "Let the Harkonnen beasts
tremble and fret themselves that an Atreides yet lives!"
Paul spoke to the Fedaykin at the telescope. "Watch the flagpole atop the
Emperor's ship. If my flag is raised there --"
"It will not be," Gurney said.
Paul saw the puzzled frown on Stilgar's face, said: "If the Emperor
recognized my claim, he'll signal by restoring the Atreides flag to Arrakis.
We'll use the second plan then, move only against the Harkonnens. The Sardaukar
will stand aside and let us settle the issue between ourselves."
"I've no experience with these offworld things," Stilgar said. "I've heard
of them, but it seems unlikely the --"
"You don't need experience to know what they'll do," Gurney said.
"They're sending a new flag up on the tall ship," the watcher said. "The
flag is yellow . . . with a black and red circle in the center."
"There's a subtle piece of business," Paul said. "The CHOAM Company flag."
"It's the same as the flag at the other ships," the Fedaykin guard said.
"I don't understand," Stilgar said.
"A subtle piece of business indeed," Gurney said. "Had he sent up the
Atreides banner, he'd have had to live by what that meant. Too many observers
about. He could've signaled with the Harkonnen flag on his staff -- a flat
declaration that'd have been. But, no -- he sends up the CHOAM rag. He's telling
the people up there . . . " Gurney pointed toward space. " . . . where the
profit is. He's saying he doesn't care if it's an Atreides here or not."
"How long till the storm strikes the Shield Wall?" Paul asked.
Stilgar turned away, consulted one of the Fedaykin in the bowl. Presently,
he returned, said: "Very soon, Muad'Dib. Sooner than we expected. It's a greatgreat-grandmother of a storm . . . perhaps even more than you wished."
"It's my storm," Paul said, and saw the silent awe on the faces of the
Fedaykin who heard him. "Though it shook the entire world it could not be more
than I wished. Will it strike the Shield Wall full on?"
"Close enough to make no difference," Stilgar said.
A courier crossed from the hole that led down into the basin, said: "The
Sardaukar and Harkonnen patrols are pulling back, Muad'Dib."
"They expect the storm to spill too much sand into the basin for good
visibility," Stilgar Said. "They think we'll be in the same fix."
"Tell our gunners to set their sights well before visibility drops," Paul
said. "They must knock the nose off every one of those ships as soon as the
storm has destroyed the shields." He stepped to the wall of the bowl, pulled
back a fold of the camouflage cover and looked up at the sky. The horsetail
twistings of blow sand could be seen against the dark of the sky. Paul restored
the cover, said: "Start sending our men down, Stil."
"Will you not go with us?" Stilgar asked.
"I'll wait here a bit with the Fedaykin," Paul said.
Stilgar gave a knowing shrug toward Gurney, moved to the hole in the rock
wall, was lost in its shadows.
"The trigger that blasts the Shield Wall aside, that I leave in your hands,
Gurney," Paul said. "You will do it?"
"I'll do it."
Paul gestured to a Fedaykin lieutenant, said: "Otheym, start moving the
check patrols out of the blast area. They must be out of there before the storm
strikes."
The man bowed, followed Stilgar.

Gurney leaned in to the rock slit, spoke to the man at the telescope: "Keep
your attention on the south wall. It'll be completely undefended until we blow
it."
"Dispatch a cielago with a time signal," Paul ordered.
"Some ground cars are moving toward the south wall," the man at the
telescope said. "Some are using projectile weapons, testing. Our people are
using body shields as you commanded. The ground cars have stopped."
In the abrupt silence, Paul heard the wind devils playing overhead -- the
front of the storm. Sand began to drift down into their bowl through gaps in the
cover. A burst of wind caught the cover, whipped it away.
Paul motioned his Fedaykin to take shelter, crossed to the men at the
communications equipment near the tunnel mouth. Gurney stayed beside him. Paul
crouched over the signalmen.
One said: "A great-great-great grandmother of a storm, Muad'Dib."
Paul glanced up at the darkening sky, said: "Gurney, have the south wall
observers pulled out." He had to repeat his order, shouting above the growing
noise of the storm.
Gurney turned to obey.
Paul fastened his face filter, tightened the stillsuit hood.
Gurney returned.
Paul touched his shoulder, pointed to the blast trigger set into the tunnel
mouth beyond the signalmen. Gurney went into the tunnel, stopped there, one hand
at the trigger, his gaze on Paul.
"We are getting no messages," the signalman beside Paul said. "Much static."
Paul nodded, kept his eye on the time-standard dial in front of the
signalman. Presently, Paul looked at Gurney, raised a hand, returned his
attention to the dial. The time counter crawled around its final circuit.
"Now!" Paul shouted, and dropped his hand.
Gurney depressed the blast trigger.
It seemed that a full second passed before they felt the ground beneath them
ripple and shake. A rumbling sound was added to the storm's roar.
The Fedaykin watcher from the telescope appeared beside Paul, the telescope
clutched under one arm. "The Shield Wall is breached, Muad'Dib!" he shouted.
"The storm is on them and our gunners already are firing."
Paul thought of the storm sweeping across the basin, the static charge
within the wall of sand that destroyed every shield barrier in the enemy camp.
"The storm!" someone shouted. "We must get under cover, Muad'Dib!"
Paul came to his senses, feeling the sand needles sting his exposed cheeks.
We are committed, he thought. He put an arm around the signalman's shoulder,
said: "Leave the equipment! There's more in the tunnel." He felt himself being
pulled away, Fedaykin pressed around him to protect him. They squeezed into the
tunnel mouth, feeling its comparative silence, turned a corner into a small
chamber with glowglobes overhead and another tunnel opening beyond.
Another signalman sat there at his equipment.
"Much static," the man said.
A swirl of sand filled the air around them.
"Seal off this tunnel!" Paul shouted. A sudden pressure of stillness showed
that his command had been obeyed. "Is the way down to the basin still open?"
Paul asked.
A Fedaykin went to look, returned, said: "The explosion caused a little rock
to fall, but the engineers say it is still open. They're cleaning up with
lasbeams."
"Tell them to use their hands!" Paul barked. "There are shields active down
there?"
"They are being careful, Muad'Dib," the man said, but he turned to obey.
The signalmen from outside pressed past them carrying their equipment.
"I told those men to leave their equipment!" Paul said.

"Fremen do not like to abandon equipment, Muad'Dib," one of his Fedaykin
chided.
"Men are more important than equipment now," Paul said. "We'll have more
equipment than we can use soon or have no need for any equipment."
Gurney Halleck came up beside him, said: "I heard them say the way down is
open. We're very close to the surface here, m'Lord, should the Harkonnens try to
retaliate in kind."
"They're in no position to retaliate," Paul said. "They're just now finding
out that they have no shields and are unable to get off Arrakis."
"The new command post is all prepared, though, m'Lord," Gurney said.
"They've no need of me in the command post yet," Paul said. "The plan would
go ahead without me. We must wait for the --"
"I'm getting a message, Muad'Dib," said the signalman at the communications
equipment. The man shook his head, pressed a receiver phone against his ear.
"Much static!" He began scribbling on a pad in front of him, shaking his head
waiting, writing . . . waiting.
Paul crossed to the signalman's side. The Fedaykin stepped back, giving him
room. He looked down at what the man had written, read:
"Raid . . . on Sietch Tabr . . . captives . . . Alia (blank) families of
(blank) dead are . . . they (blank) son of Muad'Dib . . . "
Again, the signalman shook his head.
Paul looked up to see Gurney staring at him.
"The message is garbled," Gurney said. "The static. You don't know that . .
. "
"My son is dead," Paul said, and knew as he spoke that it was true. "My son
is dead . . . and Alia is a captive . . . hostage." He felt emptied, a shell
without emotions. Everything he touched brought death and grief. And it was like
a disease that could spread across the universe.
He could feel the old-man wisdom, the accumulation out of the experiences
from countless possible lives. Something seemed to chuckle and rub its hands
within him.
And Paul thought: How little the universe knows about the nature of real
cruelty!
= = = = = =
And Muad'Dib stood before them, and he said: "Though we deem the captive dead,
yet does she live. For her seed is my seed and her voice is my voice. And she
sees unto the farthest reaches of possibility. Yea, unto the vale of the
unknowable does she see because of me."
-from "Arrakis Awakening" by the Princess Irulan
The Baron Vladimir Harkonnen stood with eyes downcast in the Imperial
audience chamber, the oval selamlik within the Padishah Emperor's hutment. With
covert glances, the Baron had studied the metal-walled room and its occupants -the noukkers, the pages, the guards, the troop of House Sardaukar drawn up
around the walls, standing at ease there beneath the bloody and tattered
captured battle flags that were the room's only decoration.
Voices sounded from the right of the chamber, echoing out of a high passage:
"Make way! Make way for the Royal Person!"
The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV came out of the passage into the audience
chamber followed by his suite. He stood waiting while his throne was brought,
ignoring the Baron, seemingly ignoring every person in the room.
The Baron found that he could not ignore the Royal Person, and studied the
Emperor for a sign, any clue to the purpose of this audience. The Emperor stood
poised, waiting -- a slim, elegant figure in a gray Sardaukar uniform with
silver and gold trim. His thin face and cold eyes reminded the Baron of the Duke
Leto long dead. There was that same look of the predatory bird. But the
Emperor's hair was red, not black, and most of that hair was concealed by a
Burseg's ebon helmet with the Imperial crest in gold upon its crown.
Pages brought the throne. It was a massive chair carved from a single piece
of Hagal quartz -- blue-green translucency shot through with streaks of yellow
fire. They placed it on the dais and the Emperor mounted, seated himself.
An old woman in a black aba robe with hood drawn down over her forehead
detached herself from the Emperor's suite, took up station behind the throne,
one scrawny hand resting on the quartz back. Her face peered out of the hood
like a witch caricature -- sunken cheeks and eyes, an overlong nose, skin
mottled and with protruding veins.
The Baron stilled his trembling at sight of her. The presence of the
Reverend Mother Gains Helen Mohiam, the Emperor's Truthsayer, betrayed the
importance of this audience. The Baron looked away from her, studied the suite
for a clue. There were two of the Guild agents, one tall and fat, one short and
fat, both with bland gray eyes. And among the lackeys stood one of the Emperor's
daughters, the Princess Irulan, a woman they said was being trained in the
deepest of the Bene Gesserit ways, destined to be a Reverend Mother. She was
tall, blonde, face of chiseled beauty, green eyes that looked past and through
him.
"My dear Baron."
The Emperor had deigned to notice him. The voice was baritone and with
exquisite control. It managed to dismiss him while greeting him.
The Baron bowed low, advanced to the required position ten paces from the
dais. "I came at your summons, Majesty."
"Summons!" the old witch cackled.
"Now, Reverend Mother," the Emperor chided, but he smiled at the Baron's
discomfiture, said: "First, you will tell me where you've sent your minion,
Thufir Hawat."
The Baron darted his gaze left and right, reviled himself for coming here
without his own guards, not that they'd be much use against Sardaukar. Still . .
.
"Well?" the Emperor said.
"He has been gone these five days, Majesty." The Baron shot a glance at the
Guild agents, back to the Emperor. "He was to land at a smuggler base and
attempt infiltrating the camp of the Fremen fanatic, this Muad'Dib."
"Incredible!" the Emperor said.
One of the witch's clawlike hands tapped the Emperor's shoulder. She leaned
forward, whispered in his ear.
The Emperor nodded, said: "Five days, Baron. Tell me, why aren't you worried
about his absence?"
"But I am worried, Majesty!"
The Emperor continued to stare at him, waiting. The Reverend Mother emitted
a cackling laugh.
"What I mean, Majesty," the Baron said, "is that Hawat will be dead within
another few hours, anyway." And he explained about the latent poison and need
for an antidote.
"How clever of you, Baron," the Emperor said. "And where are your nephews,
Rabban and the young Feyd-Rautha?"
"The storm comes, Majesty. I sent them to inspect our perimeter lest the
Fremen attack under cover of the sand."
"Perimeter," the Emperor said. The word came out as though it puckered his
mouth. "The storm won't be much here in the basin, and that Fremen rabble won't
attack while I'm here with five legions of Sardaukar."
"Surely not, Majesty," the Baron said, "But error on the side of caution
cannot be censured."
"Ah-h-h-h," the Emperor said. "Censure. Then I'm not to speak of how much
time this Arrakis nonsense has taken from me? Nor the CHOAM Company profits
pouring down this rat hole? Nor the court functions and affairs of state I've
had to delay -- even cancel -- because of this stupid affair?"
The Baron lowered his gaze, frightened by the Imperial anger. The delicacy
of his position here, alone and dependent upon the Convention and the dictum
familia of the Great Houses, fretted him. Does he mean to kill me? the Baron
asked himself. He couldn't! Not with the other Great Houses waiting up there,
aching for any excuse to gain from this upset on Arrakis.
"Have you taken hostages?" the Emperor asked.
"It's useless, Majesty," the Baron said. "These mad Fremen hold a burial
ceremony for every captive and act as though such a one were already dead."
"So?" the Emperor said.
And the Baron waited, glancing left and right at the metal walls of the
selamlik, thinking of the monstrous fanmetal tent around him. Such unlimited
wealth it represented that even the Baron was awed. He brings pages, the Baron
thought, and useless court lackeys, his women and their companions -- hairdressers, designers, everything . . . all the fringe parasites of the Court. All
here -- fawning, slyly plotting, "roughing it" with the Emperor . . . here to
watch him put an end to this affair, to make epigrams over the battles and
idolize the wounded.
"Perhaps you've never sought the right kind of hostages," the Emperor said.
He knows something, the Baron thought. Fear sat like a stone in his stomach
until he could hardly bear the thought of eating. Yet, the feeling was like
hunger, and he poised himself several times in his suspensors on the point of
ordering food brought to him. But there was no one here to obey his summons.
"Do you have any idea who this Muad'Dib could be?" the Emperor asked.
"One of the Umma, surely," the Baron said. "A Fremen fanatic, a religious
adventurer. They crop up regularly on the fringes of civilization. Your Majesty
knows this."
The Emperor glanced at his Truthsayer, turned back to scowl at the Baron.
"And you have no other knowledge of this Muad'Dib?"
"A madman," the Baron said. "But all Fremen are a little mad."
"Mad?"
"His people scream his name as they leap into battle. The women throw their
babies at us and hurl themselves onto our knives to open a wedge for their men
to attack us. They have no . . . no . . . decency!"
"As bad as that," the Emperor murmured, and his tone of derision did not
escape the Baron. "Tell me, my dear Baron, have you investigated the southern
polar regions of Arrakis?"
The Baron stared up at the Emperor, shocked by the change of subject. "But .
. . well, you know, Your Majesty, the entire region is uninhabitable, open to
wind and worm. There's not even any spice in those latitudes."
"You've had no reports from spice lighters that patches of greenery appear
there?"
"There've always been such reports. Some were investigated -- long ago. A
few plants were seen. Many 'thopters were lost. Much too costly, Your Majesty.
It's a place where men cannot survive for long."
"So," the Emperor said. He snapped his fingers and a door opened at his left
behind the throne. Through the door came two Sardaukar herding a girl-child who
appeared to be about four years old. She wore a black aba, the hood thrown back
to reveal the attachments of a stillsuit hanging free at her throat. Her eyes
were Fremen blue, staring out of a soft, round face. She appeared completely
unafraid and there was a look to her stare that made the Baron feel uneasy for
no reason he could explain.

Even the old Bene Gesserit Truthsayer drew back as the child passed and made
a warding sign in her direction. The old witch obviously was shaken by the
child's presence.
The Emperor cleared his throat to speak, but the child spoke first -- a thin
voice with traces of a soft-palate lisp, but clear nonetheless. "So here he is,"
she said. She advanced to the edge of the dais. "He doesn't appear much, does he
-- one frightened old fat man too weak to support his own flesh without the help
of suspensors."
It was such a totally unexpected statement from the mouth of a child that
the Baron stared at her, speechless in spite of his anger. Is it a midget? he
asked himself.
"My dear Baron," the Emperor said, "become acquainted with the sister of
Muad'Dib."
"The sist . . . "The Baron shifted his attention to the Emperor. "I do not
understand."
"I, too, sometimes err on the side of caution," the Emperor said. "It has
been reported to me that your uninhabited south polar regions exhibit evidence
of human activity."
"But that's impossible!" the Baron protested. "The worms . . . there's sand
clear to the . . . "
"These people seem able to avoid the worms," the Emperor said.
The child sat down on the dais beside the throne, dangled her feet over the
edge, kicking them. There was such an air of sureness in the way she appraised
her surroundings.
The Baron stared at the kicking feet, the way they moved the black robe, the
wink of sandals beneath the fabric.
"Unfortunately," the Emperor said, "I only sent in five troop carriers with
a light attack force to pick up prisoners for questioning. We barely got away
with three prisoners and one carrier. Mind you, Baron, my Sardaukar were almost
overwhelmed by a force composed mostly of women, children, and old men. This
child here was in command of one of the attacking groups."
"You see, Your Majesty!" the Baron said. "You see how they are!"
"I allowed myself to be captured," the child said. "I did not want to face
my brother and have to tell him that his son had been killed."
"Only a handful of our men got away," the Emperor said. "Got away! You hear
that?"
"We'd have had them, too," the child said, "except for the flames."
"My Sardaukar used the attitudinal jets on their carrier as flame-throwers,"
the Emperor said. "A move of desperation and the only thing that got them away
with their three prisoners. Mark that, my dear Baron: Sardaukar forced to
retreat in confusion from women and children and old men!"
"We must attack in force," the Baron rasped. "We must destroy every last
vestige of --"
"Silence!" the Emperor roared. He pushed himself forward on his throne. "Do
not abuse my intelligence any longer. You stand there in your foolish innocence
and --"
"Majesty," the old Truthsayer said.
He waved her to silence. "You say you don't know about the activity we
found, nor the fighting qualities of these superb people!" The Emperor lifted
himself half off his throne. "What do you take me for, Baron?"
The Baron took two backward steps, thinking: It was Rabban. He has done this
to me. Rabban has . . .
"And this fake dispute with Duke Leto," the Emperor purred, sinking back
into his throne. "How beautifully you maneuvered it."
"Majesty," the Baron pleaded. "What are you --"
"Silence!"
The old Bene Gesserit put a hand on the Emperor's shoulder, leaned close to
whisper in his ear.
The child seated on the dais stopped kicking her feet, said: "Make him
afraid some more, Shaddam. I shouldn't enjoy this, but I find the pleasure
impossible to suppress."
"Quiet, child," the Emperor said. He leaned forward, put a hand on her head,
stared at the Baron. "Is it possible, Baron? Could you be as simpleminded as my
Truthsayer suggests? Do you not recognize this child, daughter of your ally,
Duke Leto?"
"My father was never his ally," the child said. "My father is dead and this
old Harkonnen beast has never seen me before."
The Baron was reduced to stupefied glaring. When he found his voice it was
only to rasp: "Who?"
"I am Alia, daughter of Duke Leto and the Lady Jessica, sister of Duke PaulMuad'Dib," the child said. She pushed herself off the dais, dropped to the floor
of the audience chamber. "My brother has promised to have your head atop his
battle standard and I think he shall."
"Be hush, child," the Emperor said, and he sank back into his throne, hand
to chin, studying the Baron.
"I do not take the Emperor's orders," Alia said. She turned, looked up at
the old Reverend Mother. "She knows."
The Emperor glanced up at his Truthsayer. "What does she mean?"
"That child is an abomination!" the old woman said. "Her mother deserves a
punishment greater than anything in history. Death! It cannot come too quickly
for that child or for the one who spawned her!" The old woman pointed a finger
at Alia. "Get out of my mind!"
"T-P?" the Emperor whispered. He snapped his attention back to Alia. "By the
Great Mother!"
"You don't understand. Majesty," the old woman said. "Not telepathy. She's
in my mind. She's like the ones before me, the ones who gave me their memories.
She stands in my mind! She cannot be there, but she is!"
"What others?" the Emperor demanded. "What's this nonsense?"
The old woman straightened, lowered her pointing hand. "I've said too much,
but the fact remains that this child who is not a child must be destroyed. Long
were we warned against such a one and how to prevent such a birth, but one of
our own has betrayed us."
"You babble, old woman," Alia said. "You don't know how it was, yet you
rattle on like a purblind fool." Alia closed her eyes, took a deep breath, and
held it.
The old Reverend Mother groaned and staggered.
Alia opened her eyes. "That is how it was," she said. "A cosmic accident . .
. and you played your part in it."
The Reverend Mother held out both hands, palms pushing the air toward Alia.
"What is happening here?" the Emperor demanded. "Child, can you truly
project your thoughts into the mind of another?"
"That's not how it is at all," Alia said. "Unless I'm born as you, I cannot
think as you."
"Kill her," the old woman muttered, and clutched the back of the throne for
support. "Kill her!" The sunken old eyes glared at Alia.
"Silence," the Emperor said, and he studied Alia. "Child, can you
communicate with your brother?"
"My brother knows I'm here," Alia said.
"Can you tell him to surrender as the price of your life?"
Alia smiled up at him with clear innocence. "I shall not do that," she said.
The Baron stumbled forward to stand beside Alia. "Majesty," he pleaded, "I
knew nothing of --"
"Interrupt me once more, Baron," the Emperor said, "and you will lose the
powers of interruption . . . forever." He kept his attention focused on Alia,
studying her through slitted lids. "You will not, eh? Can you read in my mind
what I'll do if you disobey me?"
"I've already said I cannot read minds," she said, "but one doesn't need
telepathy to read your intentions."
The Emperor scowled. "Child, your cause is hopeless. I have but to rally my
forces and reduce this planet to --"
"It's not that simple," Alia said. She looked at the two Guildsmen. "Ask
them."
"It is not wise to go against my desires," the Emperor said. "You should not
deny me the least thing."
"My brother comes now," Alia said. "Even an Emperor may tremble before
Muad'Dib, for he has the strength of righteousness and heaven smiles upon him."
The Emperor surged to his feet. "This play has gone far enough. I will take
your brother and this planet and grind them to --"
The room rumbled and shook around them. There came a sudden cascade of sand
behind the throne where the hutment was coupled to the Emperor's ship. The
abrupt flicker-tightening of skin pressure told of a wide-area shield being
activated.
"I told you," Alia said. "My brother comes."
The Emperor stood in front of his throne, right hand pressed to right ear,
the servo-receiver there chattering its report on the situation. The Baron moved
two steps behind Alia. Sardaukar were leaping to positions at the doors.
"We will fall back into space and reform," the Emperor said. "Baron, my
apologies. These madmen are attacking under cover of the storm. We will show
them an Emperor's wrath, then." He pointed at Alia. "Give her body to the
storm."
As he spoke, Alia fled backward, feigning terror: "Let the storm have what
it can take!" she screamed. And she backed into the Baron's arms.
"I have her, Majesty!" the Baron shouted. "Shall I dispatch her noweeeeeeeeeeeh!" He hurled her to the floor, clutched his left arm.
"I'm sorry, Grandfather," Alia said. "You've met the Atreides gom jabbar."
She got to her feet, dropped a dark needle from her hand.
The Baron fell back. His eyes bulged as he stared at a red slash on his left
palm. "You . . . you . . . " He rolled sideways in his suspensors, a sagging
mass of flesh supported inches off the floor with head lolling and mouth hanging
open.
"These people are insane," the Emperor snarled. "Quick! Into the ship. We'll
purge this planet of every . . . "
Something sparkled to his left. A roll of ball lightning bounced away from
the wall there, crackled as it touched the metal floor. The smell of burned
insulation swept through the selamlik.
"The shield!" one of the Sardaukar officers shouted. "The outer shield is
down! They . . . "
His words were drowned in a metallic roaring as the shipwall behind the
Emperor trembled and rocked.
"They've shot the nose off our ship!" someone called.
Dust boiled through the room. Under its cover, Alia leaped up, ran toward
the outer door.
The Emperor whirled, motioned his people into an emergency door that swung
open in the ship's side behind the throne. He flashed a hand signal to a
Sardaukar officer leaping through the dust haze. "We will make our stand here!"
the Emperor ordered.
Another crash shook the hutment. The double doors banged open at the far
side of the chamber admitting wind-blown sand and the sound of shouting. A
small, black-robed figure could be seen momentarily against the light -- Alia
darting out to find a knife and, as befitted her Fremen training, to kill
Harkonnen and Sardaukar wounded. House Sardaukar charged through a greened
yellow haze toward the opening, weapons ready, forming an arc there to protect
the Emperor's retreat.
"Save yourself, Sire!" a Sardaukar officer shouted. "Into the ship!"
But the Emperor stood alone now on his dais pointing toward the doors. A
forty-meter section of the hutment had been blasted away there and the
selamlik's doors opened now onto drifting sand. A dust cloud hung low over the
outside world blowing from pastel distances. Static lightning crackled from the
cloud and the spark flashes of shields being shorted out by the storm's charge
could be seen through the haze. The plain surged with figures in combat -Sardaukar and leaping gyrating robed men who seemed to come down out of the
storm.
All this was as a frame for the target of the Emperor's pointing hand.
Out of the sand haze came an orderly mass of flashing shapes -- great rising
curves with crystal spokes that resolved into the gaping mouths of sandworms, a
massed wall of them, each with troops of Fremen riding to the attack. They came
in a hissing wedge, robes whipping in the wind as they cut through the melee on
the plain.
Onward toward the Emperor's hutment they came while the House Sardaukar
stood awed for the first time in their history by an onslaught their minds found
difficult to accept.
But the figures leaping from the worm backs were men, and the blades
flashing in that ominous yellow light were a thing the Sardaukar had been
trained to face. They threw themselves into combat. And it was man to man on the
plain of Arrakeen while a picked Sardaukar bodyguard pressed the Emperor back
into the ship, sealed the door on him, and prepared to die at that door as part
of his shield.
In the shock of comparative silence within the ship, the Emperor stared at
the wide-eyed faces of his suite, seeing his oldest daughter with the flush of
exertion on her cheeks, the old Truthsayer standing like a black shadow with her
hood pulled about her face, finding at last the faces he sought -- the two
Guildsmen. They wore the Guild gray, unadorned, and it seemed to fit the calm
they maintained despite the high emotions around them.
The taller of the two, though, held a hand to his left eye. As the Emperor
watched, someone jostled the Guildsman's arm, the hand moved, and the eye was
revealed. The man had lost one of his masking contact lenses, and the eye stared
out a total blue so dark as to be almost black.
The smaller of the pair elbowed his way a step nearer the Emperor, said: "We
cannot know how it will go." And the taller companion, hand restored to eye,
added in a cold voice: "But this Muad'Dib cannot know, either."
The words shocked the Emperor out of his daze. He checked the scorn on his
tongue by a visible effort because it did not take a Guild navigator's singleminded focus on the main chance to see the immediate future out on that plain.
Were these two so dependent upon their faculty that they had lost the use of
their eyes and their reason? he wondered.
"Reverend Mother," he said, "we must devise a plan."
She pulled the hood from her face, met his gaze with an unblinking stare.
The look that passed between them carried complete understanding. They had one
weapon left and both knew it: treachery.
"Summon Count Fenring from his quarters," the Reverend Mother said.
The Padishah Emperor nodded, waved for one of his aides to obey that
command.
= = = = = =
He was warrior and mystic, ogre and saint, the fox and the innocent, chivalrous,
ruthless, less than a god, more than a man. There is no measuring Muad'Dib's
motives by ordinary standards. In the moment of his triumph, he saw the death
prepared for him, yet he accepted the treachery. Can you say he did this out of
a sense of justice? Whose justice, then? Remember, we speak now of the Muad'Dib
who ordered battle drums made from his enemies' skins, the Muad'Dib who denied
the conventions of his ducal past with a wave of the hand, saying merely: "I am
the Kwisatz Haderach. That is reason enough. "
-from "Arrakis Awakening" by the Princess Irulan
It was to the Arrakeen governor's mansion, the old Residency the Atreides
had first occupied on Dune, that they escorted Paul-Muad'Dib on the evening of
his victory. The building stood as Rabban had restored it, virtually untouched
by the fighting although there had been looting by townspeople. Some of the
furnishings in the main hall had been overturned or smashed.
Paul strode through the main entrance with Gurney Halleck and Stilgar a pace
behind. Their escort fanned out into the Great Hall, straightening the place and
clearing an area for Muad'Dib. One squad began investigating that no sly trap
had been planted here.
"I remember the day we first came here with your father," Gurney said. He
glanced around at the beams and the high, slitted windows. "I didn't like this
place then and I like it less now. One of our caves would be safer."
"Spoken like a true Fremen," Stilgar said, and he marked the cold smile that
his words brought to Muad'Dib's lips. "Will you reconsider, Muad'Dib?"
"This place is a symbol," Paul said. "Rabban lived here. By occupying this
place I seal my victory for all to understand. Send men through the building.
Touch nothing. Just be certain no Harkonnen people or toys remain."
"As you command," Stilgar said, and reluctance was heavy in his tone as he
turned to obey.
Communications men hurried into the room with their equipment, began setting
up near the massive fireplace. The Fremen guard that augmented the surviving
Fedaykin took up stations around the room. There was muttering among them, much
darting of suspicious glances. This had been too long a place of the enemy for
them to accept their presence in it casually.
"Gurney, have an escort bring my mother and Chani," Paul said. "Does Chani
know yet about our son?"
"The message was sent, m'Lord."
"Are the makers being taken out of the basin yet?"
"Yes, m'Lord. The storm's almost spent."
"What's the extent of the storm damage?" Paul asked.
"In the direct path -- on the landing field and across the spice storage
yards of the plain -- extensive damage," Gurney said. "As much from battle as
from the storm."
"Nothing money won't repair, I presume," Paul said.
"Except for the lives, m'Lord," Gurney said, and there was a tone of
reproach in his voice as though to say: "When did an Atreides worry first about
things when people were at stake?"
But Paul could only focus his attention on the inner eye and the gaps
visible to him in the time-wall that still lay across his path. Through each gap
the jihad raged away down the corridors of the future.
He sighed, crossed the hall, seeing a chair against the wall. The chair had
once stood in the dining hall and might even have held his own father. At the
moment, though, it was only an object to rest his weariness and conceal it from
the men. He sat down, pulling his robes around his legs, loosening his stillsuit
at the neck.
"The Emperor is still holed up in the remains of his ship," Gurney said.

"For now, contain him there," Paul said. "Have they found the Harkonnens
yet?"
"They're still examining the dead."
"What reply from the ships up there?" He jerked his chin toward the ceiling.
"No reply yet, m'Lord."
Paul sighed, resting against the back of his chair. Presently, he said:
"Bring me a captive Sardaukar. We must send a message to our Emperor, It's time
to discuss terms."
"Yes, m'Lord."
Gurney turned away, dropped a hand signal to one of the Fedaykin who took up
close-guard position beside Paul.
"Gurney," Paul whispered. "Since we've been rejoined I've yet to hear you
produce the proper quotation for the event." He turned, saw Gurney swallow, saw
the sudden grim hardening of the man's jaw.
"As you wish, m'Lord," Gurney said. He cleared his throat, rasped: " 'And
the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people: for the
people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.' "
Paul closed his eyes, forcing grief out of his mind, letting it wait as he
had once waited to mourn his father. Now, he gave his thoughts over to this
day's accumulated discoveries -- the mixed futures and the hidden presence of
Alia within his awareness.
Of all the uses of time-vision, this was the strangest. "I have breasted the
future to place my words where only you can hear them," Alia had said. "Even you
cannot do that, my brother. I find it an interesting play. And . . . oh, yes -I've killed our grandfather, the demented old Baron. He had very little pain."
Silence. His time sense had seen her withdrawal.
"Muad'Dib."
Paul opened his eyes to see Stilgar's black-bearded visage above him, the
dark eyes glaring with battle light.
"You've found the body of the old Baron," Paul said.
A hush of the person settled over Stilgar. "How could you know?" he
whispered. "We just found the body in that great pile of metal the Emperor
built."
Paul ignored the question, seeing Gurney return accompanied by two Fremen
who supported a captive Sardaukar.
"Here's one of them, m'Lord," Gurney said. He signed to the guard to hold
the captive five paces in front of Paul.
The Sardaukar's eyes, Paul noted, carried a glazed expression of shock. A
blue bruise stretched from the bridge of his nose to the corner of his mouth. He
was of the blond, chisel-featured caste, the look that seemed synonymous with
rank among the Sardaukar, yet there were no insignia on his torn uniform except
the gold buttons with the Imperial crest and the tattered braid of his trousers.
"I think this one's an officer, m'Lord," Gurney said.
Paul nodded, said: "I am the Duke Paul Atreides. Do you understand that,
man?"
The Sardaukar stared at him unmoving.
"Speak up," Paul said, "or your Emperor may die."
The man blinked, swallowed.
"Who am I?" Paul demanded.
"You are the Duke Paul Atreides," the man husked.
He seemed too submissive to Paul, but then the Sardaukar had never been
prepared for such happenings as this day. They'd never known anything but
victory which, Paul realized, could be a weakness in itself. He put that thought
aside for later consideration in his own training program.
"I have a message for you to carry to the Emperor," Paul said. And he
couched his words in the ancient formula: "I, a Duke of a Great House, an
Imperial Kinsman, give my word of bond under the Convention. If the Emperor and
his people lay down their arms and come to me here I will guard their lives with
my own." Paul held up his left hand with the ducal signet for the Sardaukar to
see. "I swear it by this."
The man wet his lips with his tongue, glanced at Gurney.
"Yes," Paul said. "Who but an Atreides could command the allegiance of
Gurney Halleck."
"I will carry the message," the Sardaukar said.
"Take him to our forward command post and send him in," Paul said.
"Yes, m'Lord." Gurney motioned for the guard to obey, led them out.
Paul turned back to Stilgar.
"Chani and your mother have arrived," Stilgar said. "Chani has asked time to
be alone with her grief. The Reverend Mother sought a moment in the weirding
room; I know not why."
"My mother's sick with longing for a planet she may never see," Paul said.
"Where water falls from the sky and plants grow so thickly you cannot walk
between them."
"Water from the sky," Stilgar whispered.
In that instant, Paul saw how Stilgar had been transformed from the Fremen
naib to a creature of the Lisan al-Gaib, a receptacle for awe and obedience. It
was a lessening of the man, and Paul felt the ghost-wind of the jihad in it.
I have seen a friend become a worshiper, he thought.
In a rush of loneliness, Paul glanced around the room, noting how proper and
on-review his guards had become in his presence. He sensed the subtle, prideful
competition among them -- each hoping for notice from Muad'Dib.
Muad'Dib from whom all blessings flow, he thought, and it was the bitterest
thought of his life. They sense that I must take the throne, he thought. But
they cannot know I do it to prevent the jihad.
Stilgar cleared his throat, said: "Rabban, too, is dead."
Paul nodded.
Guards to the right suddenly snapped aside, standing at attention to open an
aisle for Jessica. She wore her black aba and walked with a hint of striding
across sand, but Paul noted how this house had restored to her something of what
she had once been here -- concubine to a ruling duke. Her presence carried some
of its old assertiveness.
Jessica stopped in front of Paul, looked down at him. She saw his fatigue
and how he hid it, but found no compassion for him. It was as though she had
been rendered incapable of any emotion for her son.
Jessica had entered the Great Hall wondering why the place refused to fit
itself snugly in to her memories. It remained a foreign room, as though she had
never walked here, never walked here with her beloved Leto, never confronted a
drunken Duncan Idaho here -- never, never, never . . .
There should be a word-tension directly opposite to adab, the demanding
memory, she thought. There should be a word for memories that deny themselves.
"Where is Alia?" she asked.
"Out doing what any good Fremen child should be doing in such times," Paul
said. "She's killing enemy wounded and marking their bodies for the waterrecovery teams."
"Paul!"
"You must understand that she does this out of kindness," he said. "Isn't it
odd how we misunderstand the hidden unity of kindness and cruelty?"
Jessica glared at her son, shocked by the profound change in him. Was it his
child's death did this? she wondered. And she said: "The men tell strange
stories of you, Paul. They say you've all the powers of the legend -- nothing
can be hidden from you, that you see where others cannot see."
"A Bene Gesserit should ask about legends?" he asked.
"I've had a hand in whatever you are," she admitted, "but you mustn't expect
me to --"
"How would you like to live billions upon billions of lives?" Paul asked.
"There's a fabric of legends for you! Think of all those experiences, the wisdom
they'd bring. But wisdom tempers love, doesn't it? And it puts a new shape on
hate. How can you tell what's ruthless unless you've plumbed the depths of both
cruelty and kindness? You should fear me, Mother. I am the Kwisatz Haderach."
Jessica tried to swallow in a dry throat. Presently, she said; "Once you
denied to me that you were the Kwisatz Haderach."
Paul shook his head. "I can deny nothing any more." He looked up into her
eyes. "The Emperor and his people come now. They will be announced any moment.
Stand beside me. I wish a clear view of them. My future bride will be among
them."
"Paul!" Jessica snapped. "Don't make the mistake your father made!"
"She's a princess," Paul said. "She's my key to the throne, and that's all
she'll ever be. Mistake? You think because I'm what you made me that I cannot
feel the need for revenge?"
"Even on the innocent?" she asked, and she thought: He must not make the
mistakes I made.
"There are no innocent any more," Paul said.
"Tell that to Chani," Jessica said, and gestured toward the passage from the
rear of the Residency.
Chani entered the Great Hall there, walking between the Fremen guards as
though unaware of them. Her hood and stillsuit cap were thrown back, face mask
fastened aside. She walked with a fragile uncertainty as she crossed the room to
stand beside Jessica.
Paul saw the marks of tears on her cheeks -- She gives water to the dead. He
felt a pang of grief strike through him, but it was as though he could only feel
this thing through Chani's presence.
"He is dead, beloved," Chani said. "Our son is dead."
Holding himself under stiff control, Paul got to his feet. He reached out,
touched Chani's cheek, feeling the dampness of her tears. "He cannot be
replaced," Paul said, "but there will be other sons. It is Usul who promises
this." Gently, he moved her aside, gestured to Stilgar.
"Muad'Dib," Stilgar said.
"They come from the ship, the Emperor and his people," Paul said. "I will
stand here. Assemble the captives in an open space in, the center of the room.
They will be kept at a distance of ten meters from me unless I command
otherwise."
"As you command, Muad'Dib."
As Stilgar turned to obey, Paul heard the awed muttering of Fremen guards:
"You see? He knew! No one told him, but he knew!"
The Emperor's entourage could be heard approaching now, his Sardaukar
humming one of their marching tunes to keep up their spirits. There came a
murmur of voices at the entrance and Gurney Halleck passed through the guard,
crossed to confer with Stilgar, then moved to Paul's side, a strange look in His
eyes.
Will I lose Gurney, too? Paul wondered. The way I lost Stilgar -- losing a
friend to gain a creature?
"They have no throwing weapons," Gurney said. "I've made sure of that
myself." He glanced around the room, seeing Paul's preparations. "Feyd-Rautha
Harkonnen is with them. Shall I cut him out?"
"Leave him."
"There're some Guild people, too, demanding special privileges, threatening
an embargo against Arrakis. I told them I'd give you their message."
"Let them threaten."
"Paul!" Jessica hissed behind him. "He's talking about the Guild!"
"I'll pull their fangs presently," Paul said.

And he thought then about the Guild -- the force that had specialized for so
long that it had become a parasite, unable to exist independently of the life
upon which it fed. They had never dared grasp the sword . . . and now they could
not grasp it. They might have taken Arrakis when they realized the error of
specializing on the melange awareness-spectrum narcotic for their navigators.
They could have done this, lived their glorious day and died. Instead, they'd
existed from moment to moment, hoping the seas in which they swam might produce
a new host when the old one died.
The Guild navigators, gifted with limited prescience, had made the fatal
decision: they'd chosen always the clear, safe course that leads ever downward
into stagnation.
Let them look closely at their new host, Paul thought.
"There's also a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother who says she's a friend of
your mother," Gurney said.
"My mother has no Bene Gesserit friends."
Again, Gurney glanced around the Great Hall, then bent close to Paul's ear.
"Thufir Hawat's with 'em, m'Lord. I had no chance to see him alone, but he used
our old hand signs to say he's been working with the Harkonnens, thought you
were dead. Says he's to be left among 'em."
"You left Thufir among those --"
"He wanted it . . . and I thought it best. If . . . there's something wrong,
he's where we can control him. If not -- we've an ear on the other side."
Paul thought then of prescient glimpses into the possibilities of this
moment -- and one time-line where Thufir carried a poisoned needle which the
Emperor commanded he use against "this upstart Duke."
The entrance guards stepped aside, formed a short corridor of lances. There
came a murmurous swish of garments, feet rasping the sand that had drifted into
the Residency.
The Padishah Emperor Shaddam IV led his people into the hall. His burseg
helmet had been lost and the red hair stood out in disarray. His uniform's left
sleeve had been ripped along the inner seam. He was beltless and without
weapons, but his presence moved with him like a force-shield bubble that kept
his immediate area open.
A Fremen lance dropped across his path, stopped him where Paul had ordered.
The others bunched up behind, a montage of color, of shuffling and of staring
faces.
Paul swept his gaze across the group, saw women who hid signs of weeping,
saw the lackeys who had come to enjoy grandstand seats at a Sardaukar victory
and now stood choked to silence by defeat. Paul saw the bird-bright eyes of the
Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam glaring beneath her black hood, and beside
her the narrow furtiveness of Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen.
There's a face time betrayed to me, Paul thought.
He looked beyond Feyd-Rautha then, attracted by a movement, seeing there a
narrow, weaselish face he'd never before encountered -- not in time or out of
it. It was a face he felt he should know and the feeling carried with it a
marker of fear.
Why should I fear that man? he wondered.
He leaned toward his mother, whispered: "That man to the left of the
Reverend Mother, the evil-looking one -- who is that?"
Jessica looked, recognizing the face from her Duke's dossiers. "Count
Fenring," she said. "The one who was here immediately before us. A geneticeunuch . . . and a killer."
The Emperor's errand boy, Paul thought. And the thought was a shock crashing
across his consciousness because he had seen the Emperor in uncounted
associations spread through the possible futures--but never once had Count
Fenring appeared within those prescient visions.

It occurred to Paul then that he had seen his own dead body along countless
reaches of the time web, but never once had he seen his moment of death.
Have I been denied a glimpse of this man because he is the one who kills me?
Paul wondered.
The thought sent a pang of foreboding through him. He forced his attention
away from Fenring, looked now at the remnants of Sardaukar men and officers, the
bitterness on their faces and the desperation. Here and there among them, faces
caught Paul's attention briefly: Sardaukar officers measuring the preparations
within this room, planning and scheming yet for a way to turn defeat into
victory.
Paul's attention came at last to a tall blonde woman, green-eyed, a face of
patrician beauty, classic in its hauteur, untouched by tears, completely
undefeated. Without being told it, Paul knew her -- Princess Royal, Bene
Gesserit -- trained, a face that time vision had shown him in many aspects:
Irulan.
There's my key, he thought.
Then he saw movement in the clustered people, a face and figure emerged -Thufir Hawat, the seamed old features with darkly stained lips, the hunched
shoulders, the look of fragile age about him.
"There's Thufir Hawat," Paul said. "Let him stand free, Gurney."
"M'Lord," Gurney said.
"Let him stand free," Paul repeated.
Gurney nodded.
Hawat shambled forward as a Fremen lance was lifted and replaced behind him.
The rheumy eyes peered at Paul, measuring, seeking.
Paul stepped forward one pace, sensed the tense, waiting movement of the
Emperor and his people.
Hawat's gaze stabbed past Paul, and the old man said: "Lady Jessica, I but
learned this day how I've wronged you in my thoughts. You needn't forgive."
Paul waited, but his mother remained silent.
"Thufir, old friend," Paul said, "as you can see, my back is toward no
door."
"The universe is full of doors," Hawat said.
"Am I my father's son?" Paul asked.
"More like your grandfather's," Hawat rasped. "You've his manner and the
look of him in your eyes."
"Yet I'm my father's son," Paul said. "For I say to you, Thufir, that in
payment for your years of service to my family you may now ask anything you wish
of me. Anything at all. Do you need my life now, Thufir? It is yours." Paul
stepped forward a pace, hands at his side, seeing the look of awareness grow in
Hawat's eyes.
He realizes that I know of the treachery, Paul thought.
Pitching his voice to carry in a half-whisper for Hawat's ears alone, Paul
said: "I mean this, Thufir. If you're to strike me, do it now."
"I but wanted to stand before you once more, my Duke," Hawat said. And Paul
became aware for the first time of the effort the old man exerted to keep from
falling. Paul reached out, supported Hawat by the shoulders, feeling the muscle
tremors beneath his hands.
"Is there pain, old friend?" Paul asked.
"There is pain, my Duke," Hawat agreed, "but the pleasure is greater." He
half turned in Paul's arms, extended his left hand, palm up, toward the Emperor,
exposing the tiny needle cupped against the fingers. "See, Majesty?" he called.
"See your traitor's needle? Did you think that I who've given my life to service
of the Atreides would give them less now?"
Paul staggered as the old man sagged in his arms, felt the death there, the
utter flaccidity. Gently, Paul lowered Hawat to the floor, straightened and
signed for guardsmen to carry the body away.

Silence held the hall while his command was obeyed.
A look of deadly waiting held the Emperor's face now. Eyes that had never
admitted fear admitted it at last.
"Majesty," Paul said, and noted the jerk of surprised attention in the tall
Princess Royal. The words had been uttered with the Bene Gesserit controlled
atonals, carrying in it every shade of contempt and scorn that Paul could put
there.
Bene-Gesserit trained indeed, Paul thought.
The Emperor cleared his throat, said: "Perhaps my respected kinsman believes
he has things all his own way now. Nothing could be more remote from fact. You
have violated the Convention, used atomics against --"
"I used atomics against a natural feature of the desert," Paul said. "It was
in my way and I was in a hurry to get to you, Majesty, to ask your explanation
for some of your strange activities."
"There's a massed armada of the Great Houses in space over Arrakis right
now," the Emperor said. "I've but to say the word and they'll --"
"Oh, yes," Paul said, "I almost forgot about them." He searched through the
Emperor's suite until he saw the faces of the two Guildsmen, spoke aside to
Gurney. "Are those the Guild agents, Gurney, the two fat ones dressed in gray
over there?"
"Yes, m'Lord."
"You two," Paul said, pointing. "Get out of there immediately and dispatch
messages that will get that fleet on its way home. After this, you'll ask my
permission before --"
"The Guild doesn't take your orders!" the taller of the two barked. He and
his companion pushed through to the barrier lances, which were raised at a nod
from Paul. The two men stepped out and the taller leveled an arm at Paul, said:
"You may very well be under embargo for your --"
"If I hear any more nonsense from either of you," Paul said, "I'll give the
order that'll destroy all spice production on Arrakis . . . forever."
"Are you mad?" the tall Guildsman demanded. He fell back half a step.
"You grant that I have the power to do this thing, then?" Paul asked.
The Guildsman seemed to stare into space for a moment, then: "Yes, you could
do it, but you must not."
"Ah-h-h," Paul said and nodded to himself. "Guild navigators, both of you,
eh?"
"Yes!"
The shorter of the pair said: "You would blind yourself, too, and condemn us
all to slow death. Have you any idea what it means to be deprived of the spice
liquor once you're addicted?"
"The eye that looks ahead to the safe course is closed forever," Paul said.
"The Guild is crippled. Humans become little isolated clusters on their isolated
planets. You know, I might do this thing out of pure spite . . . or out of
ennui."
"Let us talk this over privately," the taller Guildsman said. "I'm sure we
can come to some compromise that is --"
"Send the message to your people over Arrakis," Paul said. "I grow tired of
this argument. If that fleet over us doesn't leave soon there'll be no need for
us to talk." He nodded toward his communications men at the side of the hall.
"You may use our equipment."
"First we must discuss this," the tall Guildsman said. "We cannot just --"
"Do it!" Paul barked. "The power to destroy a thing is the absolute control
over it. You've agreed I have that power. We are not here to discuss or to
negotiate or to compromise. You will obey my orders or suffer the immediate
consequences!"
"He means it," the shorter Guildsman said. And Paul saw the fear grip them.
Slowly the two crossed to the Fremen communications equipment.

"Will they obey?" Gurney asked.
"They have a narrow vision of time," Paul said. "They can see ahead to a
blank wall marking the consequences of disobedience. Every Guild navigator on
every ship over us can look ahead to that same wall. They'll obey."
Paul turned back to look at the Emperor, said: "When they permitted you to
mount your father's throne, it was only on the assurance that you'd keep the
spice flowing. You've failed them, Majesty. Do you know the consequences?"
"Nobody permitted me to --"
"Stop playing the fool," Paul barked. "The Guild is like a village beside a
river. They need the water, but can only dip out what they require. They cannot
dam the river and control it, because that focuses attention on what they take,
it brings down eventual destruction. The spice flow, that's their river, and I
have built a dam. But my dam is such that you cannot destroy it without
destroying the river."
The Emperor brushed a hand through his red hair, glanced at the backs of the
two Guildsmen.
"Even your Bene Gesserit Truthsayer is trembling," Paul said. "There are
other poisons the Reverend Mothers can use for their tricks, but once they've
used the spice liquor, the others no longer work."
The old woman pulled her shapeless black robes around her, pressed forward
out of the crowd to stand at the barrier lances.
"Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam," Paul said. "It has been a long time
since Caladan, hasn't it?"
She looked past him at his mother, said: "Well, Jessica, I see that your son
is indeed the one. For that you can be forgiven even the abomination of your
daughter."
Paul stilled a cold, piercing anger, said: "You've never had the right or
cause to forgive my mother anything!"
The old woman locked eyes with him.
"Try your tricks on me, old witch," Paul said. "Where's your gom jabbar? Try
looking into that place where you dare not look! You'll find me there staring
out at you!"
The old woman dropped her gaze.
"Have you nothing to say?" Paul demanded.
"I welcomed you to the ranks of humans," she muttered. "Don't besmirch
that."
Paul raised his voice: "Observe her, comrades! This is a Bene Gesserit
Reverend Mother, patient in a patient cause. She could wait with her sisters -ninety generations for the proper combination of genes and environment to
produce the one person their schemes required. Observe her! She knows now that
the ninety generations have produced that person. Here I stand . . . but . . . I
. . . will . . . never . . . do . . . her . . . bidding!"
"Jessica!" the old woman screamed. "Silence him!"
"Silence him yourself," Jessica said.
Paul glared at the old woman. "For your part in all this I could gladly have
you strangled," he said. "You couldn't prevent it!" he snapped as she stiffened
in rage. "But I think it better punishment that you live out your years never
able to touch me or bend me to a single thing your scheming desires."
"Jessica, what have you done?" the old woman demanded.
"I'll give you only one thing," Paul said. "You saw part of what the race
needs, but how poorly you saw it. You think to control human breeding and
intermix a select few according to your master plan! How little you understand
of what --"
"You mustn't speak of these things!" the old woman hissed.
"Silence!" Paul roared. The word seemed to take substance as it twisted
through the air between them under Paul's control.

The old woman reeled back into the arms of those behind her, face blank with
shock at the power with which he had seized her psyche. "Jessica, "she
whispered. "Jessica."
"I remember your gom jabbar," Paul said. "You remember mine. I can kill you
with a word."
The Fremen around the ball glanced knowingly at each other. Did the legend
not say: "And his word shall carry death eternal to those who stand against
righteousness."
Paul turned his attention to the tall Princess Royal standing beside her
Emperor father. Keeping his eyes focused on her, he said: "Majesty, we both know
the way out of our difficulty."
The Emperor glanced at his daughter, back to Paul. "You dare? You! An
adventurer without family, a nobody from --"
"You've already admitted who I am," Paul said. "Royal kinsman, you said.
Let's stop this nonsense."
"I am your ruler," the Emperor said.
Paul glanced at the Guildsmen standing now at the communications equipment
and facing him. One of them nodded.
"I could force it," Paul said.
"You will not dare!" the Emperor grated.
Paul merely stared at him.
The Princess Royal put a hand on her father's arm. "Father," she said, and
her voice was silky soft, soothing.
"Don't try your tricks on me," the Emperor said. He looked at her. "You
don't need to do this, Daughter. We've other resources that --"
"But here's a man fit to be your son," she said.
The old Reverend Mother, her composure regained, forced her way to the
Emperor's side, leaned close to his ear and whispered.
"She pleads your case," Jessica said.
Paul continued to look at the golden-haired Princess. Aside to his mother,
he said: "That's Irulan, the oldest, isn't it?"
"Yes."
Chani moved up on Paul's other side, said: "Do you wish me to leave,
Muad'Dib?"
He glanced at her. "Leave? You'll never again leave my side."
"There's nothing binding between us," Chani said.
Paul looked down at her for a silent moment, then: "Speak only truth with
me, my Sihaya." As she started to reply, he silenced her with a finger to her
lips. "That which binds us cannot be loosed," he said. "Now, watch these matters
closely for I wish to see this room later through your wisdom."
The Emperor and his Truthsayer were carrying on a heated, low-voiced
argument.
Paul spoke to his mother: "She reminds him that it's part of their agreement
to place a Bene Gesserit on the throne, and Irulan is the one they've groomed
for it."
"Was that their plan?" Jessica said.
"Isn't it obvious?" Paul asked.
"I see the signs!" Jessica snapped. "My question was meant to remind you
that you should not try to teach me those matters in which I instructed you."
Paul glanced at her, caught a cold smile on her lips.
Gurney Halleck leaned between them, said: "I remind you, m'Lord, that
there's a Harkonnen in that bunch." He nodded toward the dark-haired Feyd-Rautha
pressed against a barrier lance on the left. "The one with the squinting eyes
there on the left. As evil a face as I ever say. You promised me once that --"
"Thank you, Gurney," Paul said.
"It's the na-Baron . . . Baron now that the old man's dead," Gurney said.
"He'll do for what I've in --"
"Can you take him, Gurney?" "M'Lord jests!"
"That argument between the Emperor and his witch has gone on long enough,
don't you think, Mother?"
She nodded. "Indeed."
Paul raised his voice, called out to the Emperor: "Majesty, is there a
Harkonnen among you?"
Royal disdain revealed itself in the way the Emperor turned to look at Paul.
"I believe my entourage has been placed under the protection of your ducal
word," he said.
"My question was for information only," Paul said. "I wish to know if a
Harkonnen is officially a part of your entourage or if a Harkonnen is merely
hiding behind a technicality out of cowardice."
The Emperor's smile was calculating. "Anyone accepted into the Imperial
company is a member of my entourage."
"You have the word of a Duke," Paul said, "but Muad'Dib is another matter.
He may not recognize your definition of what constitutes an entourage. My friend
Gurney Halleck wishes to kill a Harkonnen. If he --"
"Kanly!" Feyd-Rautha shouted. He pressed against the barrier lance. "Your
father named this vendetta, Atreides. You call me coward while you hide among
your women and offer to send a lackey against me!"
The old Truthsayer whispered something fiercely into the Emperor's ear, but
he pushed her aside, said: "Kanly, is it? There are strict rules for kanly."
"Paul, put a stop to this," Jessica said.
"M'Lord," Gurney said, "You promised me my day against the Harkonnens."
"You've had your day against them," Paul said and he felt a harlequin
abandon take over his emotions. He slipped his robe and hood from his shoulders,
handed them to his mother with his belt and crysknife, began unstrapping his
stillsuit. He sensed now that the universe focused on this moment.
"There's no need for this," Jessica said. "There are easier ways, Paul."
Paul stepped out of his stillsuit, slipped the crysknife from its sheath in
his mother's hand. "I know," he said. "Poison, an assassin, all the old familiar
ways."
"You promised me a Harkonnen!" Gurney hissed, and Paul marked the rage in
the man's face, the way the inkvine scar stood out dark and ridged. "You owe it
to me, m'Lord!"
"Have you suffered more from them than I?" Paul asked.
"My sister," Gurney rasped. "My years in the slave pits --"
"My father," Paul said. "My good friends and companions, Thufir Hawat and
Duncan Idaho, my years as a fugitive without rank or succor . . . and one more
thing: it is now kanly and you know as well as I the rules that must prevail."
Halleck's shoulders sagged. "M'Lord, if that swine . . . he's no more than a
beast you'd spurn with your foot and discard the shoe because it'd been
contaminated. Call in an executioner, if you must, or let me do it, but don't
offer yourself to --"
"Muad'Dib need not do this thing," Chani said.
He glanced at her, saw the fear for him in her eyes. "But the Duke Paul
must," he said.
"This is a Harkonnen animal!" Gurney rasped.
Paul hesitated on the point of revealing his own Harkonnen ancestry, stopped
at a sharp look from his mother, said merely: "But this being has human shape,
Gurney, and deserves human doubt."
Gurney said: "If he so much as --"
"Please stand aside," Paul said. He hefted the crysknife, pushed Gurney
gently aside.
"Gurney!" Jessica said. She touched Gurney's arm. "He's like his grandfather
in this mood. Don't distract him. It's the only thing you can do for him now."
And she thought: Great Mother! What irony.

The Emperor was studying Feyd-Rautha, seeing the heavy shoulders, the thick
muscles. He turned to look at Paul -- a stringy whipcord of a youth, not as
desiccated as the Arrakeen natives, but with ribs there to count, and sunken in
the flanks so that the ripple and gather of muscles could be followed under the
skin.
Jessica leaned close to Paul, pitched her voice for his ears alone: "One
thing, Son. Sometimes a dangerous person is prepared by the Bene Gesserit, a
word implanted into the deepest recesses by the old pleasure-pain methods. The
word-sound most frequently used is Uroshnor. If this one's been prepared, as I
strongly suspect, that word uttered in his ear will render his muscles flaccid
and --"
"I want no special advantage for this one," Paul said. "Step back out of my
way."
Gurney spoke to her: "Why is he doing this? Does he think to get himself
killed and achieve martyrdom? This Fremen religious prattle, is that what clouds
his reason?"
Jessica hid her face in her hands, realizing that she did not know fully why
Paul took this course. She could feel death in the room and knew that the
changed Paul was capable of such a thing as Gurney suggested. Every talent
within her focused on the need to protect her son, but there was nothing she
could do.
"Is it this religious prattle?" Gurney insisted.
"Be silent," Jessica whispered. "And pray."
The Emperor's face was touched by an abrupt smile. "If Feyd-Rautha Harkonnen
. . . of my entourage . . . so wishes," he said, "I relieve him of all restraint
and give him freedom to choose his own course in this." The Emperor waved a hand
toward Paul's Fedaykin guards. "One of your rabble has my belt and short blade.
If Feyd-Rautha wishes it, he may meet you with my blade in his hand."
"I wish it," Feyd-Rautha said, and Paul saw the elation on the man's face.
He's overconfident, Paul thought. There's a natural advantage I can accept.
"Get the Emperor's blade," Paul said, and watched as his command was obeyed.
"Put it on the floor there." He indicated a place with his foot. "Clear the
Imperial rabble back against the wall and let the Harkonnen stand clear."
A flurry of robes, scraping of feet, low-voiced commands and protests
accompanied obedience to Paul's command. The Guildsmen remained standing near
the communications equipment. They frowned at Paul in obvious indecision.
They're accustomed to seeing the future, Paul thought. In this place and
time they're blind . . . even as I am. And he sampled the time-winds, sensing
the turmoil, the storm nexus that now focused on this moment place. Even the
faint gaps were closed now. Here was the unborn jihad, he knew. Here was the
race consciousness that he had known once as his own terrible purpose. Here was
reason enough for a Kwisatz Haderach or a Lisan al-Gaib or even the halting
schemes of the Bene Gesserit. The race of humans had felt its own dormancy,
sensed itself grown stale and knew now only the need to experience turmoil in
which the genes would mingle and the strong new mixtures survive. All humans
were alive as an unconscious single organism in this moment, experiencing a kind
of sexual heat that could override any barrier.
And Paul saw how futile were any efforts of his to change any smallest bit
of this. He had thought to oppose the jihad within himself, but the jihad would
be. His legions would rage out from Arrakis even without him. They needed only
the legend he already had become. He had shown them the way, given them mastery
even over the Guild which must have the spice to exist.
A sense of failure pervaded him, and he saw through it that Feyd-Rautha
Harkonnen had slipped out of the torn uniform, stripped down to a fighting
girdle with a mail core.
This is the climax, Paul thought. From here, the future will open, the
clouds part onto a kind of glory. And if I die here, they'll say I sacrificed
myself that my spirit might lead them. And if I live, they'll say nothing can
oppose Muad'Dib.
"Is the Atreides ready?" Feyd-Rautha called, using the words of the ancient
kanly ritual.
Paul chose to answer him in the Fremen way: "May thy knife chip and
shatter!" He pointed to the Emperor's blade on the floor, indicating that FeydRautha should advance and take it.
Keeping his attention on Paul, Feyd-Rautha picked up the knife, balancing it
a moment in his hand to get the feel of it. Excitement kindled in him. This was
a fight he had dreamed about -- man against man, skill against skill with no
shields intervening. He could see a way to power opening before him because the
Emperor surely would reward whoever killed this troublesome duke. The reward
might even be that haughty daughter and a share of the throne. And this yokel
duke, this back-world adventurer could not possibly be a match for a Harkonnen
trained in every device and every treachery by a thousand arena combats. And the
yokel had no way of knowing he faced more weapons than a knife here.
Let us see if you're proof against poison! Feyd-Rautha thought. He saluted
Paul with the Emperor's blade, said: "Meet your death, fool."
"Shall we fight, cousin?" Paul asked. And he cat-footed forward, eyes on the
waiting blade, his body crouched low with his own milk-white crysknife pointing
out as though an extension of his arm.
They circled each other, bare feet grating on the floor, watching with eyes
intent for the slightest opening.
"How beautifully you dance," Feyd-Rautha said.
He's a talker, Paul thought. There's another weakness. He grows uneasy in
the face of silence.
"Have you been shriven?" Feyd-Rautha asked.
Still, Paul circled in silence.
And the old Reverend Mother, watching the fight from the press of the
Emperor's suite, felt herself trembling. The Atreides youth had called the
Harkonnen cousin. It could only mean he knew the ancestry they shared, easy to
understand because he was the Kwisatz Haderach. But the words forced her to
focus on the only thing that mattered to her here.
This could be a major catastrophe for the Bene Gesserit breeding scheme.
She had seen something of what Paul had seen here, that Feyd-Rautha might
kill but not be victorious. Another thought, though, almost overwhelmed her. Two
end products of this long and costly program faced each other in a fight to the
death that might easily claim both of them. If both died here that would leave
only Feyd-Rautha's bastard daughter, still a baby, an unknown, an unmeasured
factor, and Alia, the abomination.
"Perhaps you have only pagan rites here," Feyd-Rautha said. "Would you like
the Emperor's Truthsayer to prepare your spirit for its journey?"
Paul smiled, circling to the right, alert, his black thoughts suppressed by
the needs of the moment.
Feyd-Rautha leaped, feinting with right hand, but with the knife shifted in
a blur to his left hand.
Paul dodged easily, noting the shield-conditioned hesitation in FeydRautha's thrust. Still, it was not as great a shield conditioning as some Paul
had seen, and he sensed that Feyd-Rautha had fought before against unshielded
foes.
"Does an Atreides run or stand and fight?" Feyd-Rautha asked.
Paul resumed his silent circling. Idaho's words came back to him, the words
of training from the long-ago practice floor on Caladan: "Use the first moments
in study. You may miss many an opportunity for quick victory this way, but the
moments of study are insurance of success. Take your time and be sure."
"Perhaps you think this dance prolongs your life a few moments," Feyd-Rautha
said. "Well and good." He stopped the circling, straightened.

Paul had seen enough for a first approximation. Feyd-Rautha led to the left
side, presenting the right hip as though the mailed fighting girdle could
protect his entire side. It was the action of a man trained to the shield and
with a knife in both hands.
Or . . . And Paul hesitated . . . the girdle was more than it seemed.
The Harkonnen appeared too confident against a man who'd this day led the
forces of victory against Sardaukar legions.
Feyd-Rautha noted the hesitation, said: "Why prolong the inevitable? You but
keep me from exercising my rights over this ball of dirt."
If it's a flip-dart, Paul thought, it's a cunning one. The girdle shows no
signs of tampering.
"Why don't you speak?" Feyd-Rautha demanded.
Paul resumed his probing circle, allowing himself a cold smile at the tone
of unease in Feyd-Rautha's voice, evidence that the pressure of silence was
building.
"You smile, eh?" Feyd-Rautha asked. And he leaped in mid-sentence.
Expecting the slight hesitation, Paul almost failed to evade the downflash
of blade, felt its tip scratch his left arm. He silenced the sudden pain there,
his mind flooded with realization that the earlier hesitation had been a trick - an overfeint. Here was more of an opponent than he had expected. There would
be tricks within tricks within tricks.
"Your own Thufir Hawat taught me some of my skills," Feyd-Rautha said. "He
gave me first blood. Too bad the old fool didn't live to see it."
And Paul recalled that Idaho had once said, "Expect only what happens in the
fight. That way you'll never be surprised."
Again the two circled each other, crouched, cautious.
Paul saw the return of elation to his opponent, wondered at it. Did a
scratch signify that much to the man? Unless there were poison on the blade! But
how could there be? His own men had handled the weapon, snooped it before
passing it. They were too well trained to miss an obvious thing like that.
"That woman you were talking to over there," Feyd-Rautha said. "The little
one. Is she something special to you? A pet perhaps? Will she deserve my special
attentions?"
Paul remained silent, probing with his inner senses, examining the blood
from the wound, finding a trace of soporific from the Emperor's blade. He
realigned his own metabolism to match this threat and change the molecules of
the soporific, but he felt a thrill of doubt. They'd been prepared with
soporific on a blade. A soporific. Nothing to alert a poison snooper, but strong
enough to slow the muscles it touched. His enemies had their own plans within
plans, their own stacked treacheries.
Again Feyd-Rautha leaped, stabbing.
Paul, the smile frozen on his face, feinted with slowness as though
inhibited by the drug and at the last instant dodged to meet the downflashing
arm on the crysknife's point.
Feyd-Rautha ducked sideways and was out and away, his blade shifted to his
left hand, and the measure of him that only a slight paleness of jaw betrayed
the acid pain where Paul had cut him.
Let him know his own moment of doubt, Paul thought. Let him suspect poison.
"Treachery!" Feyd-Rautha shouted. "He's poisoned me! I do feel poison in my
arm!"
Paul dropped his cloak of silence, said: "Only a little acid to counter the
soporific on the Emperor's blade."
Feyd-Rautha matched Paul's cold smile, lifted blade in left hand for a mock
salute. His eyes glared rage behind the knife.
Paul shifted his crysknife to his left hand, matching his opponent. Again,
they circled, probing.

Feyd-Rautha began closing the space between them, edging in, knife held
high, anger showing itself in squint of eye and set of jaw. He feinted right and
under, and they were pressed against each other, knife hands gripped, straining.
Paul, cautious of Feyd-Rautha's right hip where he suspected a poison flipdart, forced the turn to the right. He almost failed to see the needlepoint
flick out beneath the belt line. A shift and a giving in Feyd-Rautha's motion
warned him. The tiny point missed Paul's flesh by the barest fraction.
On the left hip!
Treachery within treachery within treachery, Paul reminded himself. Using
Bene Gesserit-trained muscles, he sagged to catch a reflex in Feyd-Rautha, but
the necessity of avoiding the tiny point jutting from his opponent's hip threw
Paul off just enough that he missed his footing and found himself thrown hard to
the floor, Feyd-Rautha on top.
"You see it there on my hip?" Feyd-Rautha whispered. "Your death, fool." And
he began twisting himself around, forcing the poisoned needle closer and closer.
"It'll stop your muscles and my knife will finish you. There'll be never a trace
left to detect!"
Paul strained, hearing the silent screams in his mind, his cell-stamped
ancestors demanding that he use the secret word to slow Feyd-Rautha, to save
himself.
"I will not say it!" Paul gasped.
Feyd-Rautha gaped at him, caught in the merest fraction of hesitation. It
was enough for Paul to find the weakness of balance in one of his opponent's leg
muscles, and their positions were reversed. Feyd-Rautha lay partly underneath
with right hip high, unable to turn because of the tiny needlepoint caught
against the floor beneath him.
Paul twisted his left hand free, aided by the lubrication of blood from his
arm, thrust once hard up underneath Feyd-Rautha's jaw. The point slid home into
the brain. Feyd-Rautha jerked and sagged back, still held partly on his side by
the needle imbedded in the floor.
Breathing deeply to restore his calm, Paul pushed himself away and got to
his feet. He stood over the body, knife in hand, raised his eyes with deliberate
slowness to look across the room at the Emperor.
"Majesty," Paul said, "your force is reduced by one more. Shall we now shed
sham and pretense? Shall we now discuss what must be? Your daughter wed to me
and the way opened for an Atreides to sit on the throne."
The Emperor turned, looked at Count Fenring. The Count met his stare -- gray
eyes against green. The thought lay there clearly between them, their
association so long that understanding could be achieved with a glance.
Kill this upstart for me, the Emperor was saying. The Atreides is young and
resourceful, yes -- but he is also tired from long effort and he'd be no match
for you, anyway. Call him out now . . . you know the way of it. Kill him.
Slowly, Fenring moved his head, a prolonged turning until he faced Paul.
"Do it!" the Emperor hissed.
The Count focused on Paul, seeing with eyes his Lady Margot had trained in
the Bene Gesserit way, aware of the mystery and hidden grandeur about this
Atreides youth.
I could kill him, Fenring thought -- and he knew this for a truth.
Something in his own secretive depths stayed the Count then, and he glimpsed
briefly, inadequately, the advantage he held over Paul -- a way of hiding from
the youth, a furtiveness of person and motives that no eye could penetrate.
Paul, aware of some of this from the way the time nexus boiled, understood
at last why he had never seen Fenring along the webs of prescience. Fenring was
one of the might-have-beens, an almost Kwisatz Haderach, crippled by a flaw in
the genetic pattern -- a eunuch, his talent concentrated into furtiveness and
inner seclusion. A deep compassion for the Count flowed through Paul, the first
sense of brotherhood he'd ever experienced.

Fenring, reading Paul's emotion, said, "Majesty, I must refuse."
Rage overcame Shaddam IV. He took two short steps through the entourage,
cuffed Fenring viciously across the jaw.
A dark flush spread up and over the Count's face. He looked directly at the
Emperor, spoke with deliberate lack of emphasis: "We have been friends, Majesty.
What I do now is out of friendship. I shall forget that you struck me."
Paul cleared his throat, said: "We were speaking of the throne, Majesty."
The Emperor whirled, glared at Paul. "I sit on the throne!" he barked.
"You shall have a throne on Salusa Secundus," Paul said.
"I put down my arms and came here on your word of bond!" the Emperor
shouted. "You dare threaten --"
"Your person is safe in my presence," Paul said. "An Atreides promised it.
Muad'Dib, however, sentences you to your prison planet. But have no fear,
Majesty. I will ease the harshness of the place with all the powers at my
disposal. It shall become a garden world, full of gentle things."
As the hidden import of Paul's words grew in the Emperor's mind, he glared
across the room at Paul. "Now we see true motives," he sneered.
"Indeed," Paul said.
"And what of Arrakis?" the Emperor asked. "Another garden world full of
gentle things?"
"The Fremen have the word of Muad'Dib," Paul said. "There will be flowing
water here open to the sky and green oases rich with good things. But we have
the spice to think of, too. Thus, there will always be desert on Arrakis . . .
and fierce winds, and trials to toughen a man. We Fremen have a saying: 'God
created Arrakis to train the faithful.' One cannot go against the word of God."
The old Truthsayer, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam, had her own view
of the hidden meaning in Paul's words now. She glimpsed the jihad and said: "You
cannot loose these people upon the universe!"
"You will think back to the gentle ways of the Sardaukar!" Paul snapped.
"You cannot," she whispered.
"You're a Truthsayer," Paul said. "Review your words." He glanced at the
Princess Royal, back to the Emperor. "Best be done quickly, Majesty."
The Emperor turned a stricken look upon his daughter. She touched his arm,
spoke soothingly: "For this I was trained, Father."
He took a deep breath.
"You cannot stay this thing," the old Truthsayer muttered.
The Emperor straightened, standing stiffly with a look of remembered
dignity. "Who will negotiate for you, kinsman?" he asked.
Paul turned, saw his mother, her eyes heavy-lidded, standing with Chani in a
squad of Fedaykin guards. He crossed to them, stood looking down at Chani.
"I know the reasons," Chani whispered. "If it must be . . . Usul."
Paul, hearing the secret tears in her voice, touched her cheek. "My Sihaya
need fear nothing, ever," he whispered. He dropped his arm, faced his mother.
"You will negotiate for me. Mother, with Chani by your side. She has wisdom and
sharp eyes. And it is wisely said that no one bargains tougher than a Fremen.
She will be looking through the eyes of her love for me and with the thought of
her sons to be, what they will need. Listen to her."
Jessica sensed the harsh calculation in her son, put down a shudder. "What
are your instructions?" she asked.
"The Emperor's entire CHOAM Company holdings as dowry," he said.
"Entire?" She was shocked almost speechless.
"He is to be stripped. I'll want an earldom and CHOAM directorship for
Gurney Halleck, and him in the fief of Caladan. There will be titles and
attendant power for every surviving Atreides man, not excepting the lowliest
trooper."
"What of the Fremen?" Jessica asked.

"The Fremen are mine," Paul said. "What they receive shall be dispensed by
Muad'Dib. It'll begin with Stilgar as Governor on Arrakis, but that can wait."
"And for me?" Jessica asked.
"Is there something you wish?"
"Perhaps Caladan," she said, looking at Gurney. "I'm not certain. I've
become too much the Fremen . . . and the Reverend Mother. I need a time of peace
and stillness in which to think."
"That you shall have," Paul said, "and anything else that Gurney or I can
give you."
Jessica nodded, feeling suddenly old and tired. She looked at Chani. "And
for the royal concubine?"
"No title for me," Chani whispered. "Nothing. I beg of you."
Paul stared down into her eyes, remembering her suddenly as she had stood
once with little Leto in her arms, their child now dead in this violence. "I
swear to you now," he whispered, "that you'll need no title. That woman over
there will be my wife and you but a concubine because this is a political thing
and we must weld peace out of this moment, enlist the Great Houses of the
Landsraad. We must obey the forms. Yet that princess shall have no more of me
than my name. No child of mine nor touch nor softness of glance, nor instant of
desire."
"So you say now," Chani said. She glanced across the room at the tail
princess.
"Do you know so little of my son?" Jessica whispered. "See that princess
standing there, so haughty and confident. They say she has pretensions of a
literary nature. Let us hope she finds solace in such things; she'll have little
else." A bitter laugh escaped Jessica. "Think on it, Chani: that princess will
have the name, yet she'll live as less than a concubine -- never to know a
moment of tenderness from the man to whom she's bound. While we, Chani, we who
carry the name of concubine -- history will call us wives."
Excerpts from the Death Cell Interview with Bronso of IX
Q: What led you to take your particular approach to a history of Muad'dib?
A: Why should I answer your questions?
Q: Because I will preserve your words.
A: Ahhh! The ultimate appeal to a historian!
Q: Will you cooperate then?
A: Why not? But you'll never understand what inspired my Analysis of History.
Never. You Priests have too much at stake to . . .
Q: Try me.
A: Try you? Well, Again . . . why not? I was caught by the shallowness of the
common view of this planet which arises from its popular name: Dune. Not
Arrakis, notice, but Dune. History is obsessed by Dune as desert, as birthplace
of the Fremen. Such history concentrates on the customs which grew out of water
scarcity and the fact that Fremen led semi-nomadic lives in stillsuits which
recovered most of their body's moisture.
Q: Are these things not true, then?
A: They are surface truth. As well ignore what lies beneath that surface as . .
. as try to understand my birthplanet, Ix, without exploring how we derived our
name from the fact that we are the ninth planet of our sun. No . . . no. It is
not enough to see Dune as a place of savage storms. It is not enough to talk
about the threat posed by the gigantic sandworms.
Q: But such things are crucial to the Arrakeen character!
A: Crucial? Of course. But they produce a one-view planet in the same way that
Dune is a one-crop planet because it is the sole and exclusive source of the
spice, melange.
Q: Yes. Let us hear you expand on the sacred spice.
A: Sacred! As with all things sacred, it gives with one hand and takes with the
other. It extends life and allows the adept to foresee his future, but it ties
him to a cruel addiction and marks his eyes as yours are marked: total blue
without any white. Your eyes, your organs of sight, become one thing without
contrast, a single view.
Q: Such heresy brought you to this cell!
A: I was brought to this cell by your Priests. As with all priests, you learned
early to call the truth heresy.
Q: You are here because you dared to say that Paul Atreides lost something
essential to his humanity before he could become Muad'dib.
A: Not to speak of his losing his father here in the Harkonnen war. Nor the
death of Duncan Idaho, who sacrificed himself that Paul and the Lady Jessica
could escape.
Q: Your cynicism is duly noted.
A: Cynicism! That, no doubt is a greater crime than heresy. But, you see, I'm
not really a cynic. I'm just an observer and commentator. I saw true nobility in
Paul as he fled into the desert with his pregnant mother. Of course, she was a
great asset as well as a burden.
Q: The flaw in your historians is that you'll never leave well enough alone. You
see true nobility in the Holy Muad'dib, but you must append a cynical footnote.
It's no wonder that the Bene Gesserit also denounce you.
A: You Priests do well to make common cause with the Bene Gesserit Sisterhood.
They, too, survive by concealing what they do. But they cannot conceal the fact
that the Lady Jessica was a Bene Gesserit-trained adept. You know she trained
her son in the sisterhood's ways. My crime was to discuss this as a phenomenon,
to expound upon their mental arts and their genetic program. You don't want
attention called to the fact that Muad'dib was the Sisterhood's hoped for
captive messiah, that he was their kwisatz haderach before he was your prophet.
Q: If I had any doubts about your death sentence, you have dispelled them.
A: I can only die once.
Q: There are deaths and there are deaths.
A: Beware lest you make a martyr of me. I do not think Muad'dib . . . Tell me,
does Muad'dib know what you do in these dungeons?
Q: We do not trouble the Holy Family with trivia.
A: (Laughter) And for this Paul Atreides fought his way to a niche among the
Fremen! For this he learned to control and ride the sandworm! It was a mistake
to answer your questions.
Q: But I will keep my promise to preserve your words.
A: Will you really? Then listen to me carefully, you Fremen degenerate, you
Priest with no god except yourself! You have much to answer for. It was a Fremen
ritual which gave Paul his first massive dose of melange, thereby opening him to
visions of his futures. It was a Fremen ritual by which that same melange
awakened the unborn Alia in the Lady Jessica's womb. Have you considered what it
meant for Alia to be born into this universe fully cognitive, possessed of all
her mother's memories and knowledge? No rape could be more terrifying.
Q: Without the sacred melange Muad'dib would not have become leader of all
Fremen. Without her holy experience Alia would not be Alia.
A: Without your blind Fremen cruelty you would not be a priest. Ahhh, I know you
Fremen. You think Muad'dib is yours because he mated with Chani, because he
adopted Fremen customs. But he was an Atreides first and he was trained by a
Bene Gesserit adept. He possessed disciplines totally unknown to you. You
thought he brought you new organization and a new mission. He promised to
transform your desert planet into a water-rich paradise. And while he dazzled
you with such visions, he took your virginity!
Q: Such heresy does not change the fact that the Ecological Transformation of
Dune proceeds apace.
A: And I committed the heresy of tracing the roots of that transformation, of
exploring the consequences. That battle out there on the Plains of Arrakeen may
have taught the universe that Fremen could defeat Imperial Sardaukar, but what
else did it teach? When the stellar empire of the Corrino Family became a Fremen
empire under Muad'dib, what else did the Empire become? Your Jihad only took
twelve years, but what a lesson it taught. Now, the Empire understands the sham
of Muad'dib's marriage to the Princess Irulan!
Q: You dare accuse Muad'dib of sham!
A: Though you kill me for it, it's not heresy. The Princess became his consort,
not his mate. Chani, his little Fremen darling -- she's his mate. Everyone knows
this. Irulan was the key to a throne, nothing more.
Q: It's easy to see why those who conspire against Muad'dib use your Analysis of
History as their rallying argument!
A: I'll not persuade you; I know that. But the argument of the conspiracy came
before my Analysis. Twelve years of Muad'dib's Jihad created the argument.
That's what united the ancient power groups and ignited the conspiracy against
Muad'dib.
= = = = = =
Such a rich store of myths enfolds Paul Muad'dib, the Mentat Emperor, and his
sister, Alia, it is difficult to see the real persons behind these veils. But
there were, after all, a man born Paul Atreides and a woman born Alia. Their
flesh was subject to space and time. And even though their oracular powers
placed them beyond the usual limits of time and space, they came from human
stock. They experienced real events which left real traces upon a real universe.
To understand them, it must be seen that their catastrophe was the catastrophe
of all mankind. This work is dedicated, then, not to Muad'dib or his sister, but
to their heirs -- to all of us.
-Dedication in the Muad'dib Concordance as copied from The Tabla Memorium of the
Mahdi Spirit Cult
Muad'dib's Imperial reign generated more historians than any other era in
human history. Most of them argued a particular viewpoint, jealous and
sectarian, but it says something about the peculiar impact of this man that he
aroused such passions on so many diverse worlds.
Of course, he contained the ingredients of history, ideal and idealized.
This man, born Paul Atreides in an ancient Great Family, received the deep
prana-bindu training from the Lady Jessica, his Bene Gesserit mother, and had
through this a superb control over muscles and nerves. But more than that, he
was a mentat, an intellect whose capacities surpassed those of the religiously
proscribed mechanical computers used by the ancients.
Above all else, Muad'dib was the kwisatz haderach which the Sisterhood's
breeding program had sought across thousands of generations.
The kwisatz haderach, then, the one who could be "many places at once," this
prophet, this man through whom the Bene Gesserit hoped to control human destiny
-- this man became Emperor Muad'dib and executed a marriage of convenience with
a daughter of the Padishah Emperor he had defeated.
Think on the paradox, the failure implicit in this moment, for you surely
have read other histories and know the surface facts. Muad'dib's wild Fremen
did, indeed, overwhelm the Padishah Shaddam IV. They toppled the Sardaukar
legions, the allied forces of the Great Houses, the Harkonnen armies and the
mercenaries bought with money voted in the Landsraad. He brought the Spacing
Guild to its knees and placed his own sister, Alia, on the religious throne the
Bene Gesserit had thought their own.
He did all these things and more.
Muad'dib's Qizarate missionaries carried their religious war across space in
a Jihad whose major impetus endured only twelve standard years, but in that
time, religious colonialism brought all but a fraction of the human universe
under one rule.
He did this because capture of Arrakis, that planet known more often as
Dune, gave him a monopoly over the ultimate coin of the realm -- the geriatric
spice, melange, the poison that gave life.
Here was another ingredient of ideal history: a material whose psychic
chemistry unraveled Time. Without melange, the Sisterhood's Reverend Mothers
could not perform their feats of observation and human control. Without melange,
the Guild's Steersmen could not navigate across space. Without melange, billions
upon billions of Imperial citizens would die of addictive withdrawal.
Without melange, Paul-Muad'dib could not prophesy.
We know this moment of supreme power contained failure. There can be only
one answer, that completely accurate and total prediction is lethal.
Other histories say Muad'dib was defeated by obvious plotters -- the Guild,
the Sisterhood and the scientific amoralists of the Bene Tleilex with their
Face-Dancer disguises. Other histories point out the spies in Muad'dib's
household. They make much of the Dune Tarot which clouded Muad'dib's powers of
prophecy. Some show how Muad'dib was made to accept the services of a ghola, the
flesh brought back from the dead and trained to destroy him. But certainly they
must know this ghola was Duncan Idaho, the Atreides lieutenant who perished
saving the life of the young Paul.
Yet, they delineate the Qizarate cabal guided by Korba the Panegyrist. They
take us step by step through Korba's plan to make a martyr of Muad'dib and place
the blame on Chani, the Fremen concubine.

How can any of this explain the facts as history has revealed them? They
cannot. Only through the lethal nature of prophecy can we understand the failure
of such enormous and far-seeing power.
Hopefully, other historians will learn something from this revelation.
-Analysis of History: Muad'dib by Bronso of Ix
= = = = = =
There exists no separation between gods and men: one blends softly casual into
the other.
-Proverbs of Muad'dib
Despite the murderous nature of the plot he hoped to devise, the thoughts of
Scytale, the Tleilaxu Face Dancer, returned again and again to rueful
compassion.
I shall regret causing death and misery to Muad'dib, he told himself.
He kept this benignity carefully hidden from his fellow conspirators. Such
feelings told him, though, that he found it easier to identify with the victim
than with the attackers -- a thing characteristic of the Tleilaxu.
Scytale stood in bemused silence somewhat apart from the others. The
argument about psychic poison had been going on for some time now. It was
energetic and vehement, but polite in that blindly compulsive way adepts of the
Great Schools always adopted for matters close to their dogma.
"When you think you have him skewered, right then you'll find him
unwounded!"
That was the old Reverend Mother of the Bene Gesserit, Gaius Helen Mohiam,
their hostess here on Wallach IX. She was a black-robed stick figure, a witch
crone seated in a floater chair at Scytale's left. Her aba hood had been thrown
back to expose a leathery face beneath silver hair. Deeply pocketed eyes stared
out of skull-mask features.
They were using a mirabhasa language, honed phalange consonants and joined
vowels. It was an instrument for conveying fine emotional subtleties. Edric, the
Guild Steersman, replied to the Reverend Mother now with a vocal curtsy
contained in a sneer -- a lovely touch of disdainful politeness.
Scytale looked at the Guild envoy. Edric swam in a container of orange gas
only a few paces away. His container sat in the center of the transparent dome
which the Bene Gesserit had built for this meeting. The Guildsman was an
elongated figure, vaguely humanoid with finned feet and hugely fanned membranous
hands -- a fish in a strange sea. His tank's vents emitted a pale orange cloud
rich with the smell of the geriatric spice, melange.
"If we go on this way, we'll die of stupidity!"
That was the fourth person present -- the potential member of the conspiracy
-- Princess Irulan, wife (but not mate, Scytale reminded himself) of their
mutual foe. She stood at a corner of Edric's tank, a tall blond beauty, splendid
in a robe of blue whale fur and matching hat. Gold buttons glittered at her
ears. She carried herself with an aristocrat's hauteur, but something in the
absorbed smoothness of her features betrayed the controls of her Bene Gesserit
background.
Scytale's mind turned from nuances of language and faces to nuances of
location. All around the dome lay hills mangy with melting snow which reflected
mottled wet blueness from the small blue-white sun hanging at the meridian.
Why this particular place? Scytale wondered. The Bene Gesserit seldom did
anything casually. Take the dome's open plan: a more conventional and confining
space might've inflicted the Guildsman with claustrophobic nervousness.
Inhibitions in his psyche were those of birth and life off-planet in open space.
To have built this place especially for Edric, though -- what a sharp finger
that pointed at his weakness.

What here, Scytale wondered, was aimed at me?
"Have you nothing to say for yourself, Scytale?" the Reverend Mother
demanded.
"You wish to draw me into this fools' fight?" Scytale asked. "Very well.
We're dealing with a potential messiah. You don't launch a frontal attack upon
such a one. Martyrdom would defeat us."
They all stared at him.
"You think that's the only danger?" the Reverend Mother demanded, voice
wheezing.
Scytale shrugged. He had chosen a bland, round-faced appearance for this
meeting, jolly features and vapid full lips, the body of a bloated dumpling. It
occurred to him now, as he studied his fellow conspirators, that he had made an
ideal choice -- out of instinct perhaps. He alone in this group could manipulate
fleshly appearance across a wide spectrum of bodily shapes and features. He was
the human chameleon, a Face Dancer, and the shape he wore now invited others to
judge him too lightly.
"Well?" the Reverend Mother pressed.
"I was enjoying the silence," Scytale said. "Our hostilities are better left
unvoiced."
The Reverend Mother drew back, and Scytale saw her reassessing him. They
were all products of profound prana-bindu training, capable of muscle and nerve
control that few humans ever achieved. But Scytale, a Face Dancer, had muscles
and nerve linkages the others didn't even possess plus a special quality of
sympatico, a mimic's insight with which he could put on the psyche of another as
well as the other's appearance.
Scytale gave her enough time to complete the reassessment, said: "Poison!"
He uttered the word with the atonals which said he alone understood its secret
meaning.
The Guildsman stirred and his voice rolled from the glittering speaker globe
which orbited a corner of his tank above Irulan. "We're discussing psychic
poison, not a physical one."
Scytale laughed. Mirabhasa laughter could flay an opponent and he held
nothing back now.
Irulan smiled in appreciation, but the corners of the Reverend Mother's eyes
revealed a faint hint of anger.
"Stop that!" Mohiam rasped.
Scytale stopped, but he had their attention now, Edric in a silent rage, the
Reverend Mother alert in her anger, Irulan amused but puzzled.
"Our friend Edric suggests," Scytale said, "that a pair of Bene Gesserit
witches trained in all their subtle ways have not learned the true uses of
deception."
Mohiam turned to stare out at the cold hills of her Bene Gesserit homeworld.
She was beginning to see the vital thing here, Scytale realized. That was good.
Irulan, though, was another matter.
"Are you one of us or not, Scytale?" Edric asked. He stared out of tiny
rodent eyes.
"My allegiance is not the issue," Scytale said. He kept his attention on
Irulan. "You are wondering, Princess, if this was why you came all those
parsecs, risked so much?"
She nodded agreement.
"Was it to bandy platitudes with a humanoid fish or dispute with a fat
Tleilaxu Face Dancer?" Scytale asked.
She stepped away from Edric's tank, shaking her head in annoyance at the
thick odor of melange.
Edric took this moment to pop a melange pill into his mouth. He ate the
spice and breathed it and, no doubt, drank it, Scytale noted. Understandable,
because the spice heightened a Steersman's prescience, gave him the power to
guide a Guild heighliner across space at translight speeds. With spice awareness
he found that line of the ship's future which avoided peril. Edric smelled
another kind of peril now, but his crutch of prescience might not find it.
"I think it was a mistake for me to come here," Irulan said.
The Reverend Mother turned, opened her eyes, closed them, a curiously
reptilian gesture.
Scytale shifted his gaze from Irulan to the tank, inviting the Princess to
share his viewpoint. She would, Scytale knew, see Edric as a repellent figure:
the bold stare, those monstrous feet and hands moving softly in the gas, the
smoky swirling of orange eddies around him. She would wonder about his sex
habits, thinking how odd it would be to mate with such a one. Even the fieldforce generator which recreated for Edric the weightlessness of space would set
him apart from her now.
"Princess," Scytale said, "because of Edric here, your husband's oracular
sight cannot stumble upon certain incidents, including this one . . .
presumably."
"Presumably," Irulan said.
Eyes closed, the Reverend Mother nodded. "The phenomenon of prescience is
poorly understood even by its initiates," she said.
"I am a full Guild Navigator and have the Power," Edric said.
Again, the Reverend Mother opened her eyes. This time, she stared at the
Face Dancer, eyes probing with that peculiar Bene Gesserit intensity. She was
weighing minutiae.
"No, Reverend Mother," Scytale murmured, "I am not as simple as I appeared."
"We don't understand this Power of second sight," Irulan said. "There's a
point. Edric says my husband cannot see, know or predict what happens within the
sphere of a Navigator's influence. But how far does that influence extend?"
"There are people and things in our universe which I know only by their
effects," Edric said, his fish mouth held in a thin line. "I know they have been
here . . . there . . . somewhere. As water creatures stir up the currents in
their passage, so the prescient stir up Time. I have seen where your husband has
been; never have I seen him nor the people who truly share his aims and
loyalties. This is the concealment which an adept gives to those who are his."
"Irulan is not yours," Scytale said. And he looked sideways at the Princess.
"We all know why the conspiracy must be conducted only in my presence,"
Edric said.
Using the voice mode for describing a machine. Irulan said: "You have your
uses, apparently."
She sees him now for what he is, Scytale thought. Good!
"The future is a thing to be shaped," Scytale said. "Hold that thought,
Princess."
Irulan glanced at the Face Dancer.
"People who share Paul's aims and loyalties," she said. "Certain of his
Fremen legionaries, then, wear his cloak. I have seen him prophesy for them,
heard their cries of adulation for their Mahdi, their Muad'dib."
It has occurred to her, Scytale thought, that she is on trial here, that a
Judgment remains to be made which could preserve her or destroy her. She sees
the trap we set for her.
Momentarily, Scytale's gaze locked with that of the Reverend Mother and he
experienced the odd realization that they had shared this thought about Irulan.
The Bene Gesserit, of course, had briefed their Princess, primed her with the
lie adroit. But the moment always came when a Bene Gesserit must trust her own
training and instincts.
"Princess, I know what it is you most desire from the Emperor," Edric said.
"Who does not know it?" Irulan asked.
"You wish to be the founding mother of the royal dynasty," Edric said, as
though he had not heard her. "Unless you join us, that will never happen. Take
my oracular word on it. The Emperor married you for political reasons, but
you'll never share his bed."
"So the oracle is also a voyeur," Irulan sneered.
"The Emperor is more firmly wedded to his Fremen concubine than he is to
you!" Edric snapped.
"And she gives him no heir," Irulan said.
"Reason is the first victim of strong emotion," Scytale murmured. He sensed
the outpouring of Irulan's anger, saw his admonition take effect.
"She gives him no heir," Irulan said, her voice measuring out controlled
calmness, "because I am secretly administering a contraceptive. Is that the sort
of admission you wanted from me?"
"It'd not be a thing for the Emperor to discover," Edric said, smiling.
"I have lies ready for him," Irulan said. "He may have truthsense, but some
lies are easier to believe than the truth."
"You must make the choice, Princess," Scytale said, "but understand what it
is protects you."
"Paul is fair with me," she said. "I sit in his Council."
"In the twelve years you've been his Princess Consort," Edric asked, "has he
shown you the slightest warmth?"
Irulan shook her head.
"He deposed your father with his infamous Fremen horde, married you to fix
his claim to the throne, yet he has never crowned you Empress," Edric said.
"Edric tries to sway you with emotion, Princess," Scytale said. "Is that not
interesting?"
She glanced at the Face Dancer, saw the bold smile on his features, answered
it with raised eyebrows. She was fully aware now, Scytale saw, that if she left
this conference under Edric's sway, part of their plot, these moments might be
concealed from Paul's oracular vision. If she withheld commitment, though . . .
"Does it seem to you, Princess," Scytale asked, "that Edric holds undue sway
in our conspiracy?"
"I've already agreed," Edric said, "that I'll defer to the best judgment
offered in our councils."
"And who chooses the best judgment?" Scytale asked.
"Do you wish the Princess to leave here without joining us?" Edric asked.
"He wishes her commitment to be a real one," the Reverend Mother growled.
"There should be no trickery between us."
Irulan, Scytale saw, had relaxed into a thinking posture, hands concealed in
the sleeves of her robe. She would be thinking now of the bait Edric had
offered: to found a royal dynasty! She would be wondering what scheme the
conspirators had provided to protect themselves from her. She would be weighing
many things.
"Scytale," Irulan said presently, "it is said that you Tleilaxu have an odd
system of honor: your victims must always have a means of escape."
"If they can but find it," Scytale agreed.
"Am I a victim?" Irulan asked.
A burst of laughter escaped Scytale.
The Reverend Mother snorted.
"Princess," Edric said, his voice softly persuasive, "you already are one of
us, have no fear of that. Do you not spy upon the Imperial Household for your
Bene Gesserit superiors?"
"Paul knows I report to my teachers," she said.
"But don't you give them the material for strong propaganda against your
Emperor?" Edric asked.
Not "our" Emperor, Scytale noted. "Your" Emperor. Irulan is too much the
Bene Gesserit to miss that slip.
"The question is one of powers and how they may be used," Scytale said,
moving closer to the Guildsman's tank. "We of the Tleilaxu believe that in all
the universe there is only the insatiable appetite of matter, that energy is the
only true solid. And energy learns. Hear me well, Princess: energy learns. This,
we call power."
"You haven't convinced me we can defeat the Emperor," Irulan said.
"We haven't even convinced ourselves," Scytale said.
"Everywhere we turn," Irulan said, "his power confronts us. He's the kwisatz
haderach, the one who can be many places at once. He's the Mahdi whose merest
whim is absolute command to his Qizarate missionaries. He's the mentat whose
computational mind surpasses the greatest ancient computers. He is Muad'dib
whose orders to the Fremen legions depopulate planets. He possesses oracular
vision which sees into the future. He has that gene pattern which we Bene
Gesserits covet for --"
"We know his attributes," the Reverend Mother interrupted. "And we know the
abomination, his sister Alia, possesses this gene pattern. But they're also
humans, both of them. Thus, they have weaknesses."
"And where are those human weaknesses?" the Face Dancer asked. "Shall we
search for them in the religious arm of his Jihad? Can the Emperor's Qizara be
turned against him? What about the civil authority of the Great Houses? Can the
Landsraad Congress do more than raise a verbal clamor?"
"I suggest the Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles," Edric said,
turning in his tank. "CHOAM is business and business follows profits."
"Or perhaps the Emperor's mother," Scytale said. "The Lady Jessica, I
understand, remains on Caladan, but is in frequent communication with her son."
"That traitorous bitch," Mohiam said, voice level. "Would I might disown my
own hands which trained her."
"Our conspiracy requires a lever," Scytale said.
"We are more than conspirators," the Reverend Mother countered.
"Ah, yes," Scytale agreed. "We are energetic and we learn quickly. This
makes us the one true hope, the certain salvation of humankind." He spoke in the
speech mode for absolute conviction, which was perhaps the ultimate sneer
coming, as it did, from a Tleilaxu.
Only the Reverend Mother appeared to understand the subtlety. "Why?" she
asked, directing the question at Scytale.
Before the Face Dancer could answer, Edric cleared his throat, said: "Let us
not bandy philosophical nonsense. Every question can be boiled down to the one:
'Why is there anything?' Every religious, business and governmental question has
the single derivative: 'Who will exercise the power?' Alliances, combines,
complexes, they all chase mirages unless they go for the power. All else is
nonsense, as most thinking beings come to realize."
Scytale shrugged, a gesture designed solely for the Reverend Mother. Edric
had answered her question for him. The pontificating fool was their major
weakness. To make sure the Reverend Mother understood, Scytale said: "Listening
carefully to the teacher, one acquires an education."
The Reverend Mother nodded slowly.
"Princess," Edric said, "make your choice. You have been chosen as an
instrument of destiny, the very finest . . . "
"Save your praise for those who can be swayed by it," Irulan said. "Earlier,
you mentioned a ghost, a revenant with which we may contaminate the Emperor.
Explain this."
"The Atreides will defeat himself!" Edric crowed.
"Stop talking riddles!" Irulan snapped. "What is this ghost?"
"A very unusual ghost," Edric said. "It has a body and a name. The body -that's the flesh of a renowned swordmaster known as Duncan Idaho. The name . .
."
"Idaho's dead," Irulan said. "Paul has mourned the loss often in my
presence. He saw Idaho killed by my father's Sardaukar."
"Even in defeat," Edric said, "your father's Sardaukar did not abandon
wisdom. Let us suppose a wise Sardaukar commander recognized the swordmaster in
a corpse his men had slain. What then? There exist uses for such flesh and
training . . . if one acts swiftly."
"A Tleilaxu ghola," Irulan whispered, looking sideways at Scytale.
Scytale, observing her attention, exercised his Face-Dancer powers -- shape
flowing into shape, flesh moving and readjusting. Presently, a slender man stood
before her. The face remained somewhat round, but darker and with slightly
flattened features. High cheekbones formed shelves for eyes with definite
epicanthic folds. The hair was black and unruly.
"A ghola of this appearance," Edric said, pointing to Scytale.
"Or merely another Face Dancer?" Irulan asked.
"No Face Dancer," Edric said. "A Face Dancer risks exposure under prolonged
surveillance. No; let us assume that our wise Sardaukar commander had Idaho's
corpse preserved for the axolotl tanks. Why not? This corpse held the flesh and
nerves of one of the finest swordsmen in history, an adviser to the Atreides, a
military genius. What a waste to lose all that training and ability when it
might be revived as an instructor for the Sardaukar."
"I heard not a whisper of this and I was one of my father's confidantes,"
Irulan said.
"Ahh, but your father was a defeated man and within a few hours you had been
sold to the new Emperor," Edric said.
"Was it done?" she demanded.
With a maddening air of complacency, Edric said: "Let us presume that our
wise Sardaukar commander, knowing the need for speed, immediately sent the
preserved flesh of Idaho to the Bene Tleilaxu. Let us suppose further that the
commander and his men died before conveying this information to your father -who couldn't have made much use of it anyway. There would remain then a physical
fact, a bit of flesh which had been sent off to the Tleilaxu. There was only one
way for it to be sent, of course, on a heighliner. We of the Guild naturally
know every cargo we transport. Learning of this one, would we not think it
additional wisdom to purchase the ghola as a gift befitting an Emperor?"
"You've done it then," Irulan said.
Scytale, who had resumed his roly-poly first appearance, said: "As our longwinded friend indicates, we've done it."
"How has Idaho been conditioned?" Irulan asked.
"Idaho?" Edric asked, looking at the Tleilaxu. "Do you know of an Idaho,
Scytale?"
"We sold you a creature called Hayt," Scytale said.
"Ah, yes -- Hayt," Edric said. "Why did you sell him to us?"
"Because we once bred a kwisatz haderach of our own," Scytale said.
With a quick movement of her old head, the Reverend Mother looked up at him.
"You didn't tell us that!" she accused.
"You didn't ask," Scytale said.
"How did you overcome your kwisatz haderach?" Irulan asked.
"A creature who has spent his life creating one particular representation of
his selfdom will die rather than become the antithesis of that representation,"
Scytale said.
"I do not understand," Edric ventured.
"He killed himself," the Reverend Mother growled.
"Follow me well, Reverend Mother," Scytale warned, using a voice mode which
said: You are not a sex object, have never been a sex object, cannot be a sex
object.
The Tleilaxu waited for the blatant emphasis to sink in. She must not
mistake his intent. Realization must pass through anger into awareness that the
Tleilaxu certainly could not make such an accusation, knowing as he must the
breeding requirements of the Sisterhood. His words, though, contained a gutter
insult, completely out of character for a Tleilaxu.
Swiftly, using the mirabhasa placative mode, Edric tried to smooth over the
moment. "Scytale, you told us you sold Hayt because you shared our desire on how
to use him."
"Edric, you will remain silent until I give you permission to speak,"
Scytale said. And as the Guildsman started to protest, the Reverend Mother
snapped: "Shut up, Edric!"
The Guildsman drew back into his tank in flailing agitation.
"Our own transient emotions aren't pertinent to a solution of the mutual
problem," Scytale said. "They cloud reasoning because the only relevant emotion
is the basic fear which brought us to this meeting."
"We understand," Irulan said, glancing at the Reverend Mother.
"You must see the dangerous limitations of our shield," Scytale said. "The
oracle cannot chance upon what it cannot understand."
"You are devious, Scytale," Irulan said.
How devious she must not guess, Scytale thought. When this is done, we will
possess a kwisatz haderach we can control. These others will possess nothing.
"What was the origin of your kwisatz haderach?" the Reverend Mother asked.
"We've dabbled in various pure essences," Scytale said. "Pure good and pure
evil. A pure villain who delights only in creating pain and terror can be quite
educational."
"The old Baron Harkonnen, our Emperor's grandfather, was he a Tleilaxu
creation?" Irulan asked.
"Not one of ours," Scytale said. "But then nature often produces creations
as deadly as ours. We merely produce them under conditions where we can study
them."
"I will not be passed by and treated this way!" Edric protested. "Who is it
hides this meeting from --"
"You see?" Scytale asked. "Whose best judgment conceals us? What judgment?"
"I wish to discuss our mode of giving Hayt to the Emperor," Edric insisted.
"It's my understanding that Hayt reflects the old morality that the Atreides
learned on his birthworld. Hayt is supposed to make it easy for the Emperor to
enlarge his moral nature, to delineate the positive-negative elements of life
and religion."
Scytale smiled, passing a benign gaze over his companions. They were as he'd
been led to expect. The old Reverend Mother wielded her emotions like a scythe.
Irulan had been well trained for a task at which she had failed, a flawed Bene
Gesserit creation. Edric was no more (and no less) than the magician's hand: he
might conceal and distract. For now, Edric relapsed into sullen silence as the
others ignored him.
"Do I understand that this Hayt is intended to poison Paul's psyche?" Irulan
asked.
"More or less," Scytale said.
"And what of the Qizarate?" Irulan asked.
"It requires only the slightest shift in emphasis, a glissade of the
emotions, to transform envy into enmity," Scytale said.
"And CHOAM?" Irulan asked.
"They will rally round profit," Scytale said.
"What of the other power groups?"
"One invokes the name of government," Scytale said. "We will annex the less
powerful in the name of morality and progress. Our opposition will die of its
own entanglements."
"Alia, too?"
"Hayt is a multi-purpose ghola," Scytale said. "The Emperor's sister is of
an age when she can be distracted by a charming male designed for that purpose.
She will be attracted by his maleness and by his abilities as a mentat."
Mohiam allowed her old eyes to go wide in surprise. "The ghola's a mentat?
That's a dangerous move."
"To be accurate," Irulan said, "a mentat must have accurate data. What if
Paul asks him to define the purpose behind our gift?"
"Hayt will tell the truth," Scytale said. "It makes no difference."
"So you leave an escape door open for Paul," Irulan said.
"A mentat!" Mohiam muttered.
Scytale glanced at the old Reverend Mother, seeing the ancient hates which
colored her responses. From the days of the Butlerian Jihad when "thinking
machines" had been wiped from most of the universe, computers had inspired
distrust. Old emotions colored the human computer as well.
"I do not like the way you smile," Mohiam said abruptly, speaking in the
truth mode as she glared up at Scytale.
In the same mode, Scytale said: "And I think less of what pleases you. But
we must work together. We all see that." He glanced at the Guildsman. "Don't we,
Edric?"
"You teach painful lessons," Edric said. "I presume you wished to make it
plain that I must not assert myself against the combined judgments of my fellow
conspirators."
"You see, he can be taught," Scytale said.
"I see other things as well," Edric growled. "The Atreides holds a monopoly
on the spice. Without it I cannot probe the future. The Bene Gesserit lose their
truthsense. We have stockpiles, but these are finite. Melange is a powerful
coin."
"Our civilization has more than one coin," Scytale said. "Thus, the law of
supply and demand fails."
"You think to steal the secret of it," Mohiam wheezed. "And him with a
planet guarded by his mad Fremen!"
"The Fremen are civil, educated and ignorant," Scytale said. "They're not
mad. They're trained to believe, not to know. Belief can be manipulated. Only
knowledge is dangerous."
"But will I be left with something to father a royal dynasty?" Irulan asked.
They all heard the commitment in her voice, but only Edric smiled at it.
"Something," Scytale said. "Something."
"It means the end of this Atreides as a ruling force," Edric said.
"I should imagine that others less gifted as oracles have made that
prediction," Scytale said. "For them, 'mektub al mellah', as the Fremen say."
"The thing was written with salt," Irulan translated.
As she spoke, Scytale recognized what the Bene Gesserit had arrayed here for
him -- a beautiful and intelligent female who could never be his. Ah, well, he
thought, perhaps I'll copy her for another.

-Tleilaxu Theorem (unproven)
Paul sat on the edge of his bed and began stripping off his desert boots.
They smelled rancid from the lubricant which eased the action of the heelpowered pumps that drove his stillsuit. It was late. He had prolonged his
nighttime walk and caused worry for those who loved him. Admittedly, the walks
were dangerous, but it was a kind of danger he could recognize and meet
immediately. Something compelling and attractive surrounded walking anonymously
at night in the streets of Arrakeen.
He tossed the boots into the corner beneath the room's lone glowglobe,
attacked the seal strips of his stillsuit. Gods below, how tired he was! The
tiredness stopped at his muscles, though, and left his mind seething. Watching
the mundane activities of everyday life filled him with profound envy. Most of
that nameless flowing life outside the walls of his Keep couldn't be shared by
an Emperor -- but . . . to walk down a public street without attracting
attention: what a privilege! To pass by the clamoring of mendicant pilgrims, to
hear a Fremen curse a shopkeeper: "You have damp hands!" . . .
Paul smiled at the memory, slipped out of his stillsuit.
He stood naked and oddly attuned to his world. Dune was a world of paradox
now -- a world under siege, yet the center of power. To come under siege, he
decided, was the inevitable fate of power. He stared down at the green
carpeting, feeling its rough texture against his soles.
The streets had been ankle deep in sand blown over the Shield Wall on the
stratus wind. Foot traffic had churned it into choking dust which clogged
stillsuit Filters. He could smell the dust even now despite a blower cleaning at
the portals of his Keep. It was an odor full of desert memories.
Other days . . . other dangers.
Compared to those other days, the peril in his lonely walks remained minor.
But, putting on a stillsuit, he put on the desert. The suit with all its
apparatus for reclaiming his body's moisture guided his thoughts in subtle ways,
fixed his movements in a desert pattern. He became wild Fremen. More than a
disguise, the suit made of him a stranger to his city self. In the stillsuit, he
abandoned security and put on the old skills of violence. Pilgrims and townfolk
passed him then with eyes downcast. They left the wild ones strictly alone out
of prudence. If the desert had a face for city folk, it was a Fremen face
concealed by a stillsuit's mouth-nose filters.
In truth, there existed now only the small danger that someone from the old
sietch days might mark him by his walk, by his odor or by his eyes. Even then,
the chances of meeting an enemy remained small.
A swish of door hangings and a wash of light broke his reverie. Chani
entered bearing his coffee service on a platinum tray. Two slaved glowglobes
followed her, darting to their positions: one at the head of their bed, one
hovering beside her to light her work.
Chani moved with an ageless air of fragile power -- so self-contained, so
vulnerable. Something about the way she bent over the coffee service reminded
him then of their first days. Her features remained darkly elfin, seemingly
unmarked by their years -- unless one examined the outer corners of her
whiteless eyes, noting the lines there: "sandtracks," the Fremen of the desert
called them.
Steam wafted from the pot as she lifted the lid by its Hagar emerald knob.
He could tell the coffee wasn't yet ready by the way she replaced the lid. The
pot -- fluting silver female shape, pregnant -- had come to him as a ghanima, a
spoil of battle won when he'd slain the former owner in single combat. Jamis,
that'd been the man's name . . . Jamis. What an odd immortality death had earned
for Jamis. Knowing death to be inevitable, had Jamis carried that particular one
in his hand?
Chani put out cups: blue pottery squatting like attendants beneath the
immense pot. There were three cups: one for each drinker and one for all the
former owners.
"It'll only be a moment," she said.
She looked at him then, and Paul wondered how he appeared in her eyes. Was
he yet the exotic offworlder, slim and wiry but water-fat when compared to
Fremen? Had he remained the Usul of his tribal name who'd taken her in "Fremen
tau" while they'd been fugitives in the desert?
Paul stared down at his own body: hard muscles, slender . . . a few more
scars, but essentially the same despite twelve years as Emperor. Looking up, he
glimpsed his face in a shelf mirror -- blue-blue Fremen eyes, mark of spice
addiction; a sharp Atreides nose. He looked the proper grandson for an Atreides
who'd died in the bullring creating a spectacle for his people.
Something the old man had said slipped then into Paul's mind: "One who rules
assumes irrevocable responsibility for the ruled. You are a husbandman. This
demands, at times, a selfless act of love which may only be amusing to those you
rule."
People still remembered that old man with affection.
And what have I done for the Atreides name? Paul asked himself. I've loosed
the wolf among the sheep.
For a moment, he contemplated all the death and violence going on in his
mind.
"Into bed now!" Chani said in a sharp tone of command that Paul knew
would've shocked his Imperial subjects.
He obeyed, lay back with his hands behind his head, letting himself be
lulled by the pleasant familiarity of Chani's movements.
The room around them struck him suddenly with amusement. It was not at all
what the populace must imagine as the Emperor's bedchamber. The yellow light of
restless glowglobes moved the shadows in an array of colored glass jars on a
shelf behind Chani. Paul named their contents silently -- the dry ingredients of
the desert pharmacopoeia, unguents, incense, mementos . . . a pinch of sand from
Sietch Tabr, a lock of hair from their firstborn . . . long dead . . . twelve
years dead . . . an innocent bystander killed in the battle that had made Paul
Emperor.
The rich odor of spice-coffee filled the room. Paul inhaled, his glance
falling on a yellow bowl beside the tray where Chani was preparing the coffee.
The bowl held ground nuts. The inevitable poison-snooper mounted beneath the
table waved its insect arms over the food. The snooper angered him. They'd never
needed snoopers in the desert days!
"Coffee's ready," Chani said. "Are you hungry?"
His angry denial was drowned in the whistling scream of a spice lighter
hurling itself spaceward from the field outside Arrakeen.
Chani saw his anger, though, poured their coffee, put a cup near his hand.
She sat down on the foot of the bed, exposed his legs, began rubbing them where
the muscles were knotted from walking in the stillsuit. Softly, with a casual
air which did not deceive him, she said: "Let us discuss Irulan's desire for a
child."
Paul's eyes snapped wide open. He studied Chani carefully, "Irulan's been
back from Wallach less than two days," he said. "Has she been at you already?"
"We've not discussed her frustrations," Chani said.
Paul forced his mind to mental alertness, examined Chani in the harsh light
of observational minutiae, the Bene Gesserit Way his mother had taught him in
violation of her vows. It was a thing he didn't like doing with Chani. Part of
her hold on him lay in the fact he so seldom needed his tension-building powers
with her. Chani mostly avoided indiscreet questions. She maintained a Fremen
sense of good manners. Hers were more often practical questions. What interested
Chani were facts which bore on the position of her man -- his strength in
Council, the loyalty of his legions, the abilities and talents of his allies.
Her memory held catalogs of names and cross-indexed details. She could rattle
off the major weakness of every known enemy, the potential dispositions of
opposing forces, battle plans of their military leaders, the tooling and
production capacities of basic industries.
Why now, Paul wondered, did she ask about Irulan?
"I've troubled your mind," Chani said. "That wasn't my intention."
"What was your intention?"
She smiled shyly, meeting his gaze. "If you're angered, love, please don't
hide it."
Paul sank back against the headboard. "Shall I put her away?" he asked. "Her
use is limited now and I don't like the things I sense about her trip home to
the Sisterhood."
"You'll not put her away," Chani said. She went on massaging his legs, spoke
matter-of-factly: "You've said many times she's your contact with our enemies,
that you can read their plans through her actions."
"Then why ask about her desire for a child?"
"I think it'd disconcert our enemies and put Irulan in a vulnerable position
should you make her pregnant."
He read by the movements of her hands on his legs what that statement had
cost her. A lump rose in his throat. Softly, he said: "Chani, beloved, I swore
an oath never to take her into my bed. A child would give her too much power.
Would you have her displace you?"
"I have no place."
"Not so, Sihaya, my desert springtime. What is this sudden concern for
Irulan?"
"It's concern for you, not for her! If she carried an Atreides child, her
friends would question her loyalties. The less trust our enemies place in her,
the less use she is to them."
"A child for her could mean your death," Paul said. "You know the plotting
in this place." A movement of his arm encompassed the Keep.
"You must have an heir!" she husked.
"Ahhh," he said.
So that was it: Chani had not produced a child for him. Someone else, then,
must do it. Why not Irulan? That was the way Chani's mind worked. And it must be
done in an act of love because all the Empire avowed strong taboos against
artificial ways. Chani had come to a Fremen decision.
Paul studied her face in this new light. It was a face he knew better in
some ways than his own. He had seen this face soft with passion, in the
sweetness of sleep, awash in fears and angers and griefs.
He closed his eyes, and Chani came into his memories as a girl once more -veiled in springtime, singing, waking from sleep beside him -- so perfect that
the very vision of her consumed him. In his memory, she smiled . . . shyly at
first, then strained against the vision as though she longed to escape.
Paul's mouth went dry. For a moment, his nostrils tasted the smoke of a
devastated future and the voice of another kind of vision commanding him to
disengage . . . disengage . . . disengage. His prophetic visions had been
eavesdropping on eternity for such a long while, catching snatches of foreign
tongues, listening to stones and to flesh not his own. Since the day of his
first encounter with terrible purpose, he had peered at the future, hoping to
find peace.
There existed a way, of course. He knew it by heart without knowing the
heart of it -- a rote future, strict in its instructions to him: disengage,
disengage, disengage . . .
Paul opened his eyes, looked at the decision in Chani's face. She had
stopped massaging his legs, sat still now -- purest Fremen. Her features
remained familiar beneath the blue nezhoni scarf she often wore about her hair
in the privacy of their chambers. But the mask of decision sat on her, an
ancient and alien-to-him way of thinking. Fremen women had shared their men for
thousands of years -- not always in peace, but with a way of making the fact
nondestructive. Something mysteriously Fremen in this fashion had happened in
Chani.
"You'll give me the only heir I want," he said.
"You've seen this?" she asked, making it obvious by her emphasis that she
referred to prescience.
As he had done many times, Paul wondered how he could explain the delicacy
of the oracle, the Timelines without number which vision waved before him on an
undulating fabric. He sighed, remembered water lifted from a river in the hollow
of his hands -- trembling, draining. Memory drenched his face in it. How could
he drench himself in futures growing increasingly obscure from the pressures of
too many oracles?
"You've not seen it, then," Chani said.
That vision-future scarce any longer accessible to him except at the
expenditure of life-draining effort, what could it show them except grief? Paul
asked himself. He felt that he occupied an inhospitable middle zone, a wasted
place where his emotions drifted, swayed, swept outward in unchecked
restlessness.
Chani covered his legs, said: "An heir to House Atreides, this is not
something you leave to chance or one woman."
That was a thing his mother might've said, Paul thought. He wondered if the
Lady Jessica had been in secret communication with Chani. His mother would think
in terms of House Atreides. It was a pattern bred and conditioned into her by
the Bene Gesserit, and would hold true even now when her powers were turned
against the Sisterhood.
"You listened when Irulan came to me today," he accused.
"I listened." She spoke without looking at him.
Paul focused his memory on the encounter with Irulan. He'd let himself into
the family salon, noted an unfinished robe on Chani's loom. There'd been an
acrid wormsmell to the place, an evil odor which almost hid the underlying
cinnamon bite of melange. Someone had spilled unchanged spice essence and left
it to combine there with a spice-based rug. It had not been a felicitous
combination. Spice essence had dissolved the rug. Oily marks lay congealed on
the plastone floor where the rug had been. He'd thought to send for someone to
clean away the mess, but Harah, Stilgar's wife and Chani's closest feminine
friend, had slipped in to announce Irulan.
He'd been forced to conduct the interview in the presence of that evil
smell, unable to escape a Fremen superstition that evil smells foretold
disaster.
Harah withdrew as Irulan entered.
"Welcome," Paul said.
Irulan wore a robe of gray whale fur. She pulled it close, touched a hand to
her hair. He could see her wondering at his mild tone. The angry words she'd
obviously prepared for this meeting could be sensed leaving her mind in a welter
of second thoughts.
"You came to report that the Sisterhood had lost its last vestige of
morality," he said.
"Isn't it dangerous to be that ridiculous?" she asked.
"To be ridiculous and dangerous, a questionable alliance," he said. His
renegade Bene Gesserit training detected her putting down an impulse to
withdraw. The effort exposed a brief glimpse of underlying fear, and he saw
she'd been assigned a task not to her liking.
"They expect a bit too much from a princess of the blood royal," he said.
Irulan grew very still and Paul became aware that she had locked herself
into a viselike control. A heavy burden, indeed, he thought. And he wondered why
prescient visions had given him no glimpse of this possible future.
Slowly, Irulan relaxed. There was no point in surrendering to fear, no point
in retreat, she had decided.
"You've allowed the weather to fall into a very primitive pattern," she
said, rubbing her arms through the robe. "It was dry and there was a sandstorm
today. Are you never going to let it rain here?"
"You didn't come here to talk about the weather," Paul said. He felt that he
had been submerged in double meanings. Was Irulan trying to tell him something
which her training would not permit her to say openly? It seemed that way. He
felt that he had been cast adrift suddenly and now must thrash his way back to
some steady place.
"I must have a child," she said.
He shook his head from side to side.
"I must have my way!" she snapped. "If need be, I'll find another father for
my child. I'll cuckold you and dare you to expose me."
"Cuckold me all you wish," he said, "but no child."
"How can you stop me?"
With a smile of upmost kindness, he said: "I'd have you garroted, if it came
to that."
Shocked silence held her for a moment and Paul sensed Chani listened behind
the heavy draperies into their private apartments.
"I am your wife," Irulan whispered.
"Let us not play these silly games," he said. "You play a part, no more. We
both know who my wife is."
"And I am a convenience, nothing more," she said, voice heavy with
bitterness.
"I have no wish to be cruel to you," he said.
"You chose me for this position."
"Not I," he said. "Fate chose you. Your father chose you. The Bene Gesserit
chose you. The Guild chose you. And they have chosen you once more. For what
have they chosen you, Irulan?"
"Why can't I have your child?"
"Because that's a role for which you weren't chosen."
"It's my right to bear the royal heir! My father was --"
"Your father was and is a beast. We both know he'd lost almost all touch
with the humanity he was supposed to rule and protect."
"Was he hated less than you're hated?" she flared.
"A good question," he agreed, a sardonic smile touching the edges of his
mouth.
"You say you've no wish to be cruel to me, yet . . . "
"And that's why I agree that you can take any lover you choose. But
understand me well: take a lover, but bring no sour-fathered child into my
household. I would deny such a child. I don't begrudge you any male alliance as
long as you are discreet . . . and childless. I'd be silly to feel otherwise
under the circumstances. But don't presume upon this license which I freely
bestow. Where the throne is concerned, I control what blood is heir to it. The
Bene Gesserit doesn't control this, nor does the Guild. This is one of the
privileges I won when I smashed your father's Sardaukar legions out there on the
Plain of Arrakeen."
"It's on your head, then," Irulan said. She whirled and swept out of the
chamber.
Remembering the encounter now, Paul brought his awareness out of it and
focused on Chani seated beside him on their bed. He could understand his
ambivalent feelings about Irulan, understand Chani's Fremen decision. Under
other circumstances Chani and Irulan might have been friends.
"What have you decided?" Chani asked.
"No child," he said.
Chani made the Fremen crysknife sign with the index finger and thumb of her
right hand.
"It could come to that," he agreed.
"You don't think a child would solve anything with Irulan?" she asked.
"Only a fool would think that."
"I am not a fool, my love."
Anger possessed him. "I've never said you were! But this isn't some damned
romantic novel we're discussing. That's a real princess down the hall. She was
raised in all the nasty intrigues of an Imperial Court. Plotting is as natural
to her as writing her stupid histories!"
"They are not stupid, love."
"Probably not." He brought his anger under control, took her hand in his.
"Sorry. But that woman has many plots -- plots within plots. Give into one of
her ambitions and you could advance another of them."
Her voice mild, Chani said: "Haven't I always said as much?"
"Yes, of course you have." He stared at her. "Then what are you really
trying to say to me?"
She lay down beside him, placed her hand against his neck. "They have come
to a decision on how to fight you," she said. "Irulan reeks of secret
decisions."
Paul stroked her hair.
Chani had peeled away the dross.
Terrible purpose brushed him. It was a coriolis wind in his soul. It
whistled through the framework of his being. His body knew things then never
learned in consciousness.
"Chani, beloved," he whispered, "do you know what I'd spend to end the Jihad
-- to separate myself from the damnable godhead the Qizarate forces onto me?"
She trembled. "You have but to command it," she said.
"Oh, no. Even if I died now, my name would still lead them. When I think of
the Atreides name tied to this religious butchery . . . "
"But you're the Emperor! You've --"
"I'm a figurehead. When godhead's given, that's the one thing the so-called
god no longer controls." A bitter laugh shook him. He sensed the future looking
back at him out of dynasties not even dreamed. He felt his being cast out,
crying, unchained from the rings of fate -- only his name continued. "I was
chosen," he said. "Perhaps at birth . . . certainly before I had much say in it.
I was chosen."
"Then un-choose," she said.
His arm tightened around her shoulder. "In time, beloved. Give me yet a
little time."
Unshed tears burned his eyes.
"We should return to Sietch Tabr," Chani said. "There's too much to contend
with in this tent of stone."
He nodded, his chin moving against the smooth fabric of the scarf which
covered her hair. The soothing spice smell of her filled his nostrils.
Sietch. The ancient Chakobsa word absorbed him: a place of retreat and
safety in a time of peril. Chani's suggestion made him long for vistas of open
sand, for clean distances where one could see an enemy coming from a long way
off.
"The tribes expect Muad'dib to return to them," she said. She lifted her
head to look at him. "You belong to us."
"I belong to a vision," he whispered.
He thought then of the Jihad, of the gene mingling across parsecs and the
vision which told him how he might end it. Should he pay the price? All the
hatefulness would evaporate, dying as fires die -- ember by ember. But . . . oh!
The terrifying price!
I never wanted to be a god, he thought. I wanted only to disappear like a
jewel of trace dew caught by the morning. I wanted to escape the angels and the
damned -- alone . . . as though by an oversight.
"Will we go back to the Sietch?" Chani pressed.
"Yes," he whispered. And he thought: I must pay the price.
Chani heaved a deep sigh, settled back against him.
I've loitered, he thought. And he saw how he'd been hemmed in by boundaries
of love and the Jihad. And what was one life, no matter how beloved, against all
the lives the Jihad was certain to take? Could single misery be weighed against
the agony of multitudes?
"Love?" Chani said, questioning.
He put a hand against her lips.
I'll yield up myself, he thought. I'll rush out while I yet have the
strength, fly through a space a bird might not find. It was a useless thought,
and he knew it. The Jihad would follow his ghost.
What could he answer? he wondered. How explain when people taxed him with
brutal foolishness? Who might understand?
I wanted only to look back and say: "There! There's an existence which
couldn't hold me. See! I vanish! No restraint or net of human devising can trap
me ever again. I renounce my religion! This glorious instant is mine! I'm free!"
What empty words!
"A big worm was seen below the Shield Wall yesterday," Chani said. "More
than a hundred meters long, they say. Such big ones come rarely into this region
any more. The water repels them, I suppose. They say this one came to summon
Muad'dib home to his desert." She pinched his chest. "Don't laugh at me!"
"I'm not laughing."
Paul, caught by wonder at the persistent Fremen mythos, felt a heart
constriction, a thing inflicted upon his lifeline: adab, the demanding memory.
He recalled his childhood room on Caladan then . . . dark night in the stone
chamber . . . a vision! It'd been one of his earliest prescient moments. He felt
his mind dive into the vision, saw through a veiled cloud-memory (vision-withinvision) a line of Fremen, their robes trimmed with dust. They paraded past a gap
in tall rocks. They carried a long, cloth-wrapped burden.
And Paul heard himself say in the vision: "It was mostly sweet . . . but you
were the sweetest of all . . . "
Adab released him.
"You're so quiet," Chani whispered. "What is it?"
Paul shuddered, sat up, face averted. "You're angry because I've been to the
desert's edge," Chani said.
He shook his head without speaking.
"I only went because I want a child," Chani said.
Paul was unable to speak. He felt himself consumed by the raw power of that
early vision. Terrible purpose! In that moment, his whole life was a limb shaken
by the departure of a bird . . . and the bird was chance. Free will.
I succumbed to the lure of the oracle, he thought.
And he sensed that succumbing to this lure might be to fix himself upon a
single-track life. Could it be, he wondered, that the oracle didn't tell the
future? Could it be that the oracle made the future? Had he exposed his life to
some web of underlying threads, trapped himself there in that long-ago
awakening, victim of a spider-future which even now advanced upon him with
terrifying jaws.
A Bene Gesserit axiom slipped into his mind: 'To use raw power is to make
yourself infinitely vulnerable to greater powers.'
"I know it angers you," Chani said, touching his arm. "It's true that the
tribes have revived the old rites and the blood sacrifices, but I took no part
in those."
Paul inhaled a deep, trembling breath. The torrent of his vision dissipated,
became a deep, still place whose currents moved with absorbing power beyond his
reach.
"Please," Chani begged. "I want a child, our child. Is that a terrible
thing?"
Paul caressed her arm where she touched him, pulled away. He climbed from
the bed, extinguished the glowglobes, crossed to the balcony window, opened the
draperies. The deep desert could not intrude here except by its odors. A
windowless wall climbed to the night sky across from him. Moonlight slanted down
into an enclosed garden, sentinel trees and broad leaves, wet foliage. He could
see a fishpond reflecting stars among the leaves, pockets of white floral
brilliance in the shadows. Momentarily, he saw the garden through Fremen eyes:
alien, menacing, dangerous in its waste of water.
He thought of the Water Sellers, their way destroyed by the lavish
dispensing from his hands. They hated him. He'd slain the past. And there were
others, even those who'd fought for the sols to buy precious water, who hated
him for changing the old ways. As the ecological pattern dictated by Muad'dib
remade the planet's landscape, human resistance increased. Was it not
presumptuous, he wondered, to think he could make over an entire planet -everything growing where and how he told it to grow? Even if he succeeded, what
of the universe waiting out there? Did it fear similar treatment?
Abruptly, he closed the draperies, sealed the ventilators. He turned toward
Chani in the darkness, felt her waiting there. Her water rings tinkled like the
almsbells of pilgrims. He groped his way to the sound, encountered her
outstretched arms.
"Beloved," she whispered. "Have I troubled you?"
Her arms enclosed his future as they enclosed him.
"Not you," he said. "Oh . . . not you."

The advent of the Field Process shield and the lasgun with their explosive
interaction, deadly to attacker and attacked, placed the current determinatives,
on weapons technology. We need not go into the special role of atomics. The fact
that any Family in my Empire could so deploy its atomics as to destroy the
planetary bases of fifty or more other Families causes some nervousness, true.
But all of us possess precautionary plans for devastating retaliation. Guild and
Landsraad contain the keys which hold this force in check, No, my concern goes
to the development of humans as special weapons. Here is a virtually unlimited
field which a few powers are developing.
-Muad'dib: Lecture to the War College from The Stilgar Chronicle
The old man stood in his doorway peering out with blue-in-blue eyes. The
eyes were veiled by that native suspicion all desert folk held for strangers.
Bitter lines tortured the edges of his mouth where it could be seen through a
fringe of white beard. He wore no stillsuit and it said much that he ignored
this fact in the full knowledge of the moisture pouring from his house through
the open door.
Scytale bowed, gave the greeting signal of the conspiracy.
From somewhere behind the old man came the sound of a rebec wailing through
the atonal dissonance of semuta music. The old man's manner carried no drug
dullness, an indication that semuta was the weakness of another. It seemed
strange to Scytale, though, to find that sophisticated vice in this place.
"Greetings from afar," Scytale said, smiling through the flat-featured face
he had chosen for this encounter. It occurred to him, then, that this old man
might recognize the chosen face. Some of the older Fremen here on Dune had known
Duncan Idaho.
The choice of features, which he had thought amusing, might have been a
mistake, Scytale decided. But he dared not change the face out here. He cast
nervous glances up and down the street. Would the old man never invite him
inside?
"Did you know my son?" the old man asked.
That, at least, was one of the countersigns. Scytale made the proper
response, all the time keeping his eyes alert for any suspicious circumstance in
his surroundings. He did not like his position here. The street was a cul-de-sac
ending in this house. The houses all around had been built for veterans of the
Jihad. They formed a suburb of Arrakeen which stretched into the Imperial Basin
past Tiemag. The walls which hemmed in this street presented blank faces of dun
plasmeld broken by dark shadows of sealed doorways and, here and there, scrawled
obscenities. Beside this very door someone had chalked a pronouncement that one
Beris had brought back to Arrakis a loathsome disease which deprived him of his
manhood.
"Do you come in partnership," the old man asked.
"Alone," Scytale said.
The old man cleared his throat, still hesitating in that maddening way.
Scytale cautioned himself to patience. Contact in this fashion carried its
own dangers. Perhaps the old man knew some reason for carrying on this way. It
was the proper hour, though. The pale sun stood almost directly overhead. People
of this quarter remained sealed in their houses to sleep through the hot part of
the day.
Was it the new neighbor who bothered the old man? Scytale wondered. The
adjoining house, he knew, had been assigned to Otheym, once a member of
Muad'dib's dreaded Fedaykin death commandos. And Bijaz, the catalyst-dwarf,
waited with Otheym.
Scytale returned his gaze to the old man, noted the empty sleeve dangling
from the left shoulder and the lack of a stillsuit. An air of command hung about
this old man. He'd been no foot slogger in the Jihad.
"May I know the visitor's name?" the old man asked.
Scytale suppressed a sigh of relief. He was to be accepted, after all. "I am
Zaal," he said, giving the name assigned him for this mission.
"I am Farok," the old man said, "once Bashar of the Ninth Legion in the
Jihad. Does this mean anything to you?"
Scytale read menace in the words, said: "You were born in Sietch Tabr with
allegiance to Stilgar."
Farok relaxed, stepped aside. "You are welcome in my house."
Scytale slipped past him into a shadowy atrium -- blue tile floor,
glittering designs worked in crystal on the walls. Beyond the atrium was a
covered courtyard. Light admitted by translucent filters spread an opalescence
as silvery as the white-night of First Moon. The street door grated into its
moisture seals behind him.
"We were a noble people," Farok said, leading the way toward the courtyard.
"We were not of the cast-out. We lived in no graben village . . . such as this!
We had a proper sietch in the Shield Wall above Habbanya Ridge. One worm could
carry us into Kedem, the inner desert."
"Not like this," Scytale agreed, realizing now what had brought Farok into
the conspiracy. The Fremen longed for the old days and the old ways.
They entered the courtyard.
Farok struggled with an intense dislike for his visitor, Scytale realized.
Fremen distrusted eyes that were not the total blue of the Ibad. Offworlders,
Fremen said, had unfocused eyes which saw things they were not supposed to see.
The semuta music had stopped at their entrance. It was replaced now by the
strum of a baliset, first a nine-scale chord, then the clear notes of a song
which was popular on the Naraj worlds.
As his eyes adjusted to the light, Scytale saw a youth sitting cross-legged
on a low divan beneath arches to his right. The youth's eyes were empty sockets.
With that uncanny facility of the blind, he began singing the moment Scytale
focused on him. The voice was high and sweet:
"A wind has blown the land away
And blown the sky away
And all the men!
Who is this wind?
The trees stand unbent,
Drinking where men drank.
I've known too many worlds,
Too many men,
Too many trees,
Too many winds."
Those were not the original words of the song, Scytale noted. Farok led him
away from the youth and under the arches on the opposite side, indicated
cushions scattered over the tile floor. The tile was worked into designs of sea
creatures.
"There is a cushion once occupied in sietch by Muad'dib," Farok said,
indicating a round, black mound. "It is yours now."
"I am in your debt," Scytale said, sinking to the black mound. He smiled.
Farok displayed wisdom. A sage spoke of loyalty even while listening to songs of
hidden meaning and words with secret messages. Who could deny the terrifying
powers of the tyrant Emperor?
Inserting his words across the song without breaking the meter, Farok said:
"Does my son's music disturb you?"
Scytale gestured to a cushion facing him, put his back against a cool
pillar. "I enjoy music."
"My son lost his eyes in the conquest of Naraj," Farok said. "He was nursed
there and should have stayed. No woman of the people will have him thus. I find
it curious, though, to know I have grandchildren on Naraj that I may never see.
Do you know the Naraj worlds, Zaal?"
"In my youth, I toured there with a troupe of my fellow Face Dancers,"
Scytale said.
"You are a Face Dancer, then," Farok said. "I had wondered at your features.
They reminded me of a man I knew here once."
"Duncan Idaho?"
"That one, yes. A swordmaster in the Emperor's pay."
"He was killed, so it is said."
"So it is said," Farok agreed. "Are you truly a man, then? I've heard
stories about Face Dancers that . . ." He shrugged.
"We are Jadacha hermaphrodites," Scytale said, "either sex at will. For the
present, I am a man."
Farok pursed his lips in thought, then: "May I call for refreshments? Do you
desire water? Iced fruit?"
"Talk will suffice," Scytale said.
"The guest's wish is a command," Farok said, settling to the cushion which
faced Scytale.
"Blessed is Abu d' Dhur, Father of the Indefinite Roads of Time," Scytale
said. And he thought: There! I've told him straight out that I come from a Guild
Steersman and wear the Steersman's conconcealment.
"Thrice blessed," Farok said, folding his hands into his lap in the ritual
clasp. They were old, heavily veined hands.
"An object seen from a distance betrays only its principle," Scytale said,
revealing that he wished to discuss the Emperor's fortress Keep.
"That which is dark and evil may be seen for evil at any distance," Farok
said, advising delay.
Why? Scytale wondered. But he said: "How did your son lose his eyes?"
"The Naraj defenders used a stone burner," Farok said. "My son was too
close. Cursed atomics! Even the stone burner should be outlawed."
"It skirts the intent of the law," Scytale agreed. And he thought: A stone
burner on Naraj! We weren't told of that. Why does this old man speak of stone
burners here?
"I offered to buy Tleilaxu eyes for him from your masters," Farok said. "But
there's a story in the legions that Tleilaxu eyes enslave their users. My son
told me that such eyes are metal and he is flesh, that such a union must be
sinful."
"The principle of an object must fit its original intent," Scytale said,
trying to turn the conversation back to the information he sought.
Farok's lips went thin, but he nodded. "Speak openly of what you wish," he
said. "We must put our trust in your steersman."
"Have you ever entered the Imperial Keep?" Scytale asked.
"I was there for the feast celebrating the Molitor victory. It was cold in
all that stone despite the best Ixian space heaters. We slept on the terrace of
Alia's Fane the night before. He has trees in there, you know -- trees from many
worlds. We Bashars were dressed in our finest green robes and had our tables set
apart. We ate and drank too much. I was disgusted with some of the things I saw.
The walking wounded came, dragging themselves along on their crutches. I do not
think our Muad'dib knows how many men he has maimed."
"You objected to the feast?" Scytale asked, speaking from a knowledge of the
Fremen orgies which were ignited by spice-beer.
"It was not like the mingling of our souls in the sietch," Farok said.
"There was no tau. For entertainment, the troups had slave girls, and the men
shared the stories of their battles and their wounds."
"So you were inside that great pile of stone," Scytale said.
"Muad'dib came out to us on the terrace," Farok said. " 'Good fortune to us
all,' he said. The greeting drill of the desert in that place!"
"Do you know the location of his private apartments?" Scytale asked.
"Deep inside," Farok said. "Somewhere deep inside. I am told he and Chani
live a nomadic life and that all within the walls of their Keep. Out to the
Great Hall he comes for the public audiences. He has reception halls and formal
meeting places, a whole wing for his personal guard, places for the ceremonies
and an inner section for communications. There is a room far beneath his
fortress, I am told, where he keeps a stunted worm surrounded by a water moat
with which to poison it. Here is where he reads the future."
Myth all tangled up with facts, Scytale thought.
"The apparatus of government accompanies him everywhere," Farok grumbled.
"Clerks and attendants and attendants for the attendants. He trusts only the
ones such as Stilgar who were very close to him in the old days."
"Not you," Scytale said.
"I think he has forgotten my existence," Farok said.
"How does he come and go when he leaves that building?" Scytale asked.
"He has a tiny 'thopter landing which juts from an inner wall." Farok said.
"I am told Muad'dib will not permit another to handle the controls for a landing
there. It requires an approach, so it is said, where the slightest
miscalculation would plunge him down a sheer cliff of wall into one of his
accursed gardens."
Scytale nodded. This, most likely, was true. Such an aerial entry to the
Emperor's quarters would carry a certain measure of security. The Atreides were
superb pilots all.
"He uses men to carry his distrans messages," Farok said. "It demeans men to
implant wave translators in them. A man's voice should be his own to command. It
should not carry another man's message hidden within its sounds."
Scytale shrugged. All great powers used the distrans in this age. One could
never tell what obstacle might be placed between sender and addressee. The
distrans defied political cryptology because it relied on subtle distortions of
natural sound patterns which could be scrambled with enormous intricacy.
"Even his tax officials use this method," Farok complained. "In my day, the
distrans was implanted only in the lower animals."
But revenue information must be kept secret, Scytale thought. More than one
government has fallen because people discovered the real extent of official
wealth.

"How do the Fremen cohorts feel now about Muad'dib's Jihad?" Scytale asked.
"Do they object to making a god out of their Emperor?"
"Most of them don't even consider this," Farok said. "They think of the
Jihad the way I thought of it -- most of them. It is a source of strange
experiences, adventure, wealth. This graben hovel in which I live" -- Farok
gestured at the courtyard -- "it cost sixty lidas of spice. Ninety kontars!
There was a time when I could not even imagine such riches." He shook his head.
Across the courtyard, the blind youth took up the notes of a love ballad on
his baliset.
Ninety kontars, Scytale thought. How strange. Great riches, certainly.
Farok's hovel would be a palace on many another world, but all things were
relative -- even the kontar. Did Farok, for example, know whence came his
measure for this weight of spice? Did he ever think to himself that one and a
half kontar once limited a camel load? Not likely. Farok might never even have
heard of a camel or of the Golden Age of Earth.
His words oddly in rhythm to the melody of his son's baliset, Farok said: "I
owned a crysknife, water rings to ten liters, my own lance which had been my
father's, a coffee service, a bottle made of red glass older than any memory in
my sietch. I had my own share of our spice, but no money. I was rich and did not
know it. Two wives I had: one plain and dear to me, the other stupid and
obstinate, but with form and face of an angel. I was a Fremen Naib, a rider of
worms, master of the leviathan and of the sand."
The youth across the courtyard picked up the beat of his melody.
"I knew many things without the need to think about them," Farok said. "I
knew there was water far beneath our sand, held there in bondage by the Little
Makers. I knew that my ancestors sacrificed virgins to Shai-hulud . . . before
Liet-Kynes made us stop. I had seen the jewels in the mouth of a worm. My soul
had four gates and I knew them all."
He fell silent, musing.
"Then the Atreides came with his witch mother," Scytale said.
"The Atreides came," Farok agreed. "The one we named Usul in our sietch, his
private name among us. Our Muad'dib, our Mahdi! And when he called for the
Jihad, I was one of those who asked: 'Why should I go to fight there? I have no
relatives there.' But other men went -- young men, friends, companions of my
childhood. When they returned, they spoke of wizardry, of the power in this
Atreides savior. He fought our enemy, the Harkonnen. Liet-Kynes, who had
promised us a paradise upon our planet, blessed him. It was said this Atreides
came to change our world and our universe, that he was the man to make the
golden flower blossom in the night."
Farok held up his hands, examined the palms. "Men pointed to First Moon and
said: 'His soul is there.' Thus, he was called Muad'dib. I did not understand
all this."
He lowered his hands, stared across the courtyard at his son. "I had no
thoughts in my head. There were thoughts only in my heart and my belly and my
loins."
Again, the tempo of the background music increased.
"Do you know why I enlisted in the Jihad?" The old eyes stared hard at
Scytale. "I heard there was a thing called a sea. It is very hard to believe in
a sea when you have lived only here among our dunes. We have no seas. Men of
Dune had never known a sea. We had our windtraps. We collected water for the
great change Liet-Kynes promised us . . . this great change Muad'dib is bringing
with a wave of his hand. I could imagine a qanat, water flowing across the land
in a canal. From this, my mind could picture a river. But a sea?"
Farok gazed at the translucent cover of his courtyard as though trying to
probe into the universe beyond. "A sea," he said, voice low. "It was too much
for my mind to picture. Yet, men I knew said they had seen this marvel. I
thought they lied, but I had to know for myself. It was for this reason that I
enlisted."
The youth struck a loud final chord on the baliset, took up a new song with
an oddly undulating rhythm.
"Did you find your sea?" Scytale asked.
Farok remained silent and Scytale thought the old man had not heard. The
baliset music rose around them and fell like a tidal movement. Farok breathed to
its rhythm.
"There was a sunset," Farok said presently. "One of the elder artists might
have painted such a sunset. It had red in it the color of the glass in my
bottle. There was gold . . . blue. It was on the world they call Enfeil, the one
where I led my legion to victory. We came out of a mountain pass where the air
was sick with water. I could scarcely breathe it. And there below me was the
thing my friends had told me about: water as far as I could see and farther. We
marched down to it. I waded out into it and drank. It was bitter and made me
ill. But the wonder of it has never left me."
Scytale found himself sharing the old Fremen's awe.
"I immersed myself in that sea," Farok said, looking down at the water
creatures worked into the tiles of his floor. "One man sank beneath that water .
. . another man arose from it. I felt that I could remember a past which had
never been. I stared around me with eyes which could accept anything . . .
anything at all. I saw a body in the water -- one of the defenders we had slain.
There was a log nearby supported on that water, a piece of a great tree. I can
close my eyes now and see that log. It was black on one end from a fire. And
there was a piece of cloth in that water -- no more than a yellow rag . . .
torn, dirty. I looked at all these things and I understood why they had come to
this place. It was for me to see them."
Farok turned slowly, stared into Scytale's eyes. "The universe is
unfinished, you know," he said.
This one is garrulous, but deep, Scytale thought. And he said: "I can see it
made a profound impression on you."
"You are a Tleilaxu," Farok said. "You have seen many seas. I have seen only
this one, yet I know a thing about seas which you do not."
Scytale found himself in the grip of an odd feeling of disquiet.
"The Mother of Chaos was born in a sea," Farok said. "A Qizara Tafwid stood
nearby when I came dripping from that water. He had not entered the sea. He
stood on the sand . . . it was wet sand . . . with some of my men who shared his
fear. He watched me with eyes that knew I had learned something which was denied
to him. I had become a sea creature and I frightened him. The sea healed me of
the Jihad and I think he saw this."
Scytale realized that somewhere in this recital the music had stopped. He
found it disturbing that he could not place the instant when the baliset had
fallen silent.
As though it were relevant to what he'd been recounting, Farok said: "Every
gate is guarded. There's no way into the Emperor's fortress."
"That's its weakness," Scytale said.
Farok stretched his neck upward, peering.
"There's a way in," Scytale explained. "The fact that most men -- including,
we may hope, the Emperor -- believe otherwise . . . that's to our advantage." He
rubbed his lips, feeling the strangeness of the visage he'd chosen. The
musician's silence bothered him. Did it mean Farok's son was through
transmitting? That had been the way of it, naturally: The message condensed and
transmitted within the music. It had been impressed upon Scytale's own neutral
system, there to be triggered at the proper moment by the distrans embedded in
his adrenal cortex. If it was ended, he had become a container of unknown words.
He was a vessel sloshing with data: every cell of the conspiracy here on
Arrakis, every name, every contact phrase -- all the vital information.

With this information, they could brave Arrakis, capture a sandworm, begin
the culture of melange somewhere beyond Muad'dib's writ. They could break the
monopoly as they broke Muad'dib. They could do many things with this
information.
"We have the woman here," Farok said. "Do you wish to see her now?"
"I've seen her," Scytale said. "I've studied her with care. Where is she?"
Farok snapped his fingers.
The youth took up his rebec, drew the bow across it. Semuta music wailed
from the strings. As though drawn by the sound, a young woman in a blue robe
emerged from a doorway behind the musician. Narcotic dullness filled her eyes
which were the total blue of the Ibad. She was a Fremen, addicted to the spice,
and now caught by an offworld vice. Her awareness lay deep within the semuta,
lost somewhere and riding the ecstasy of the music.
"Otheym's daughter," Farok said. "My son gave her the narcotic in the hope
of winning a woman of the People for himself despite his blindness. As you can
see, his victory is empty. Semuta has taken what he hoped to gain."
"Her father doesn't know?" Scytale asked.
"She doesn't even know," Farok said. "My son supplies false memories with
which she accounts to herself for her visits. She thinks herself in love with
him. This is what her family believes. They are outraged because he is not a
complete man, but they won't interfere, of course."
The music trailed away to silence.
At a gesture from the musician, the young woman seated herself beside him,
bent close to listen as he murmured to her.
"What will you do with her?" Farok asked.
Once more, Scytale studied the courtyard. "Who else is in this house?" he
asked.
"We are all here now," Farok said. "You've not told me what you'll do with
the woman. It is my son who wishes to know."
As though about to answer, Scytale extended his right arm. From the sleeve
of his robe, a glistening needle darted, embedded itself in Farok's neck. There
was no outcry, no change of posture. Farok would be dead in a minute, but he sat
unmoving, frozen by the dart's poison.
Slowly, Scytale climbed to his feet, crossed to the blind musician. The
youth was still murmuring to the young woman when the dart whipped into him.
Scytale took the young woman's arm, urged her gently to her feet, shifted
his own appearance before she looked at him. She came erect, focused on him.
"What is it, Farok?" she asked.
"My son is tired and must rest," Scytale said. "Come. We'll go out the back
way."
"We had such a nice talk," she said. "I think I've convinced him to get
Tleilaxu eyes. It'd make a man of him again."
"Haven't I said it many times?" Scytale asked, urging her into a rear
chamber.
His voice, he noted with pride, matched his features precisely. It
unmistakably was the voice of the old Fremen, who certainly was dead by this
time.
Scytale sighed. It had been done with sympathy, he told himself, and the
victims certainly had known their peril. Now, the young woman would have to be
given her chance.

-Words of Muad'dib by Princess Irulan.

It was going to be a bad session, this meeting of the Imperial Council, Alia
realized. She sensed contention gathering force, storing up energy -- the way
Irulan refused to look at Chani, Stilgar's nervous shuffling of papers, the
scowls Paul directed at Korba the Qizara.
She seated herself at the end of the golden council table so she could look
out the balcony windows at the dusty light of the afternoon.
Korba, interrupted by her entrance, went on with something he'd been saying
to Paul. "What I mean, m'Lord, is that there aren't as many gods as once there
were."
Alia laughed, throwing her head back. The movement dropped the black hood of
her aba robe. Her features lay exposed -- blue-in-blue "spice eyes," her
mother's oval face beneath a cap of bronze hair, small nose, mouth wide and
generous.
Korba's cheeks went almost the color of his orange robe. He glared at Alia,
an angry gnome, bald and fuming.
"Do you know what's being said about your brother?" he demanded.
"I know what's being said about your Qizarate," Alia countered. "You're not
divines, you're god's spies."
Korba glanced at Paul for support, said: "We are sent by the writ of
Muad'dib, that He shall know the truth of His people and they shall know the
truth of Him."
"Spies," Alia said.
Korba pursed his lips in injured silence.
Paul looked at his sister, wondering why she provoked Korba. Abruptly, he
saw that Alia had passed into womanhood, beautiful with the first blazing
innocence of youth. He found himself surprised that he hadn't noticed it until
this moment. She was fifteen -- almost sixteen, a Reverend Mother without
motherhood, virgin priestess, object of fearful veneration for the superstitious
masses -- Alia of the Knife.
"This is not the time or place for your sister's levity," Irulan said.
Paul ignored her, nodded to Korba. "The square's full of pilgrims. Go out
and lead their prayer."
"But they expect you, m'Lord," Korba said.
"Put on your turban," Paul said. "They'll never know at this distance."
Irulan smothered irritation at being ignored, watched Korba arise to obey.
She'd had the sudden disquieting thought that Edric might not hide her actions
from Alia. What do we really know of the sister? she wondered.
Chani, hands tightly clasped in her lap, glanced across the table at
Stilgar, her uncle, Paul's Minister of State. Did the old Fremen Naib ever long
for the simpler life of his desert sietch? she wondered. Stilgar's black hair,
she noted, had begun to gray at the edges, but his eyes beneath heavy brows
remained far-seeing. It was the eagle stare of the wild, and his beard still
carried the catchtube indentation of life in a stillsuit.
Made nervous by Chani's attention, Stilgar looked around the Council
Chamber. His gaze fell on the balcony window and Korba standing outside. Korba
raised outstretched arms for the benediction and a trick of the afternoon sun
cast a red halo onto the window behind him. For a moment, Stilgar saw the Court
Qizara as a figure crucified on a fiery wheel. Korba lowered his arms, destroyed
the illusion, but Stilgar remained shaken by it. His thoughts went in angry
frustration to the fawning supplicants waiting in the Audience Hall, and to the
hateful pomp which surrounded Muad'dib's throne.
Convening with the Emperor, one hoped for a fault in him, to find mistakes,
Stilgar thought. He felt this might be sacrilege, but wanted it anyway.
Distant crowd murmuring entered the chamber as Korba returned. The balcony
door thumped into its seals behind him, shutting off the sound.

Paul's gaze followed the Qizara. Korba took his seat at Paul's left, dark
features composed, eyes glazed by fanaticism. He'd enjoyed that moment of
religious power.
"The spirit presence has been invoked," he said.
"Thank the lord for that," Alia said.
Korba's lips went white.
Again, Paul studied his sister, wondered at her motives. Her innocence
masked deception, he told himself. She'd come out of the same Bene Gesserit
breeding program as he had. What had the kwisatz haderach genetics produced in
her? There was always that mysterious difference: she'd been an embryo in the
womb when her mother had survived the raw melange poison. Mother and unborn
daughter had become Reverend Mothers simultaneously. But simultaneity didn't
carry identity.
Of the experience, Alia said that in one terrifying instant she had awakened
to consciousness, her memory absorbing the uncounted other-lives which her
mother was assimilating.
"I became my mother and all the others," she said. "I was unformed, unborn,
but I became an old woman then and there."
Sensing his thoughts on her, Alia smiled at Paul. His expression softened.
How could anyone react to Korba with other than cynical humor? he asked himself.
What is more ridiculous than a Death Commando transformed into a priest?
Stilgar tapped his papers, "if my liege permits," he said. "These are
matters urgent and dire."
"The Tupile Treaty?" Paul asked.
"The Guild maintains that we must sign this treaty without knowing the
precise location of the Tupile Entente," Stilgar said. "They've some support
from Landsraad delegates."
"What pressures have you brought to bear?" Irulan asked.
"Those pressures which my Emperor has designated for this enterprise,"
Stilgar said. The stiff formality of his reply contained all his disapproval of
the Princess Consort.
"My Lord and husband," Irulan said, turning to Paul, forcing him to
acknowledge her.
Emphasizing the titular difference in front of Chani, Paul thought, is a
weakness. In such moments, he shared Stiliar's dislike for Irulan, but sympathy
tempered his emotions. What was Irulan but a Bene Gesserit pawn?
"Yes?" Paul said.
Irulan stared at him. "If you withheld their melange . . ."
Chani shook her head in dissent.
"We tread with caution," Paul said. "Tupile remains the place of sanctuary
for defeated Great Houses. It symbolizes a last resort, a final place of safety
for all our subjects. Exposing the sanctuary makes it vulnerable."
"If they can hide people they can hide other things," Stilgar rumbled. "An
army, perhaps, or the beginnings of melange culture which --"
"You don't back people into a corner," Alia said. "Not if you want them to
remain peaceful." Ruefully, she saw that she'd been drawn into the contention
which she'd foreseen.
"So we've spent ten years of negotiation for nothing," Irulan said.
"None of my brother's actions is for nothing," Alia said.
Irulan picked up a scribe, gripped it with white-knuckled intensity. Paul
saw her marshal emotional control in the Bene Gesserit way: the penetrating
inward stare, deep breathing. He could almost hear her repeating the litany.
Presently, she said: "What have we gained?"
"We've kept the Guild off balance," Chani said.
"We want to avoid a showdown confrontation with our enemies," Alia said. "We
have no special desire to kill them. There's enough butchery going on under the
Atreides banner."
She feels it, too, Paul thought. Strange, what a sense of compelling
responsibility they both felt for that brawling, idolatrous universe with its
ecstasies of tranquility and wild motion. Must we protect them from themselves?
he wondered. They play with nothingness every moment -- empty lives, empty
words. They ask too much of me. His throat felt tight and full. How many moments
would he lose? What sons? What dreams? Was it worth the price his vision had
revealed? Who would ask the living of some far distant future, who would say to
them: "But for Muad'dib, you would not be here."
"Denying them their melange would solve nothing," Chani said. "So the
Guild's navigators would lose their ability to see into timespace. Your Sisters
of the Bene Gesserit would lose their truthsense. Some people might die before
their time. Communication would break down. Who could be blamed?"
"They wouldn't let it come to that," Irulan said.
"Wouldn't they?" Chani asked. "Why not? Who could blame the Guild? They'd be
helpless, demonstrably so."
"We'll sign the treaty as it stands," Paul said.
"M'Lord," Stilgar said, concentrating on his hands, "there is a question in
our minds."
"Yes?" Paul gave the old Fremen his full attention.
"You have certain . . . powers," Stilgar said. "Can you not locate the
Entente despite the Guild?"
Powers! Paul thought. Stilgar couldn't just say: "You're prescient. Can't
you trace a path in the future that leads to Tupile?"
Paul looked at the golden surface of the table. Always the same problem: How
could he express the limits of the inexpressible? Should he speak of
fragmentation, the natural destiny of all power? How could someone who'd never
experienced the spice change of prescience conceive an awareness containing no
localized spacetime, no personal image-vector nor associated sensory captives?
He looked at Alia, found her attention on Irulan. Alia sensed his movement,
glanced at him, nodded toward Irulan. Ahhh, yes: any answer they gave would find
its way into one of Irulan's special reports to the Bene Gesserit. They never
gave up seeking an answer to their kwisatz haderach.
Stilgar, though, deserved an answer of some kind. For that matter, so did
Irulan.
"The uninitiated try to conceive of prescience as obeying a Natural Law,"
Paul said. He steepled his hands in front of him. "But it'd be just as correct
to say it's heaven speaking to us, that being able to read the future is a
harmonious act of man's being. In other words, prediction is a natural
consequence in the wave of the present. It wears the guise of nature, you see.
But such powers cannot be used from an attitude that prestates aims and
purposes. Does a chip caught in the wave say where it's going? There's no cause
and effect in the oracle. Causes become occasions of convections and
confluences, places where the currents meet. Accepting prescience, you fill your
being with concepts repugnant to the intellect. Your intellectual consciousness,
therefore, rejects them. In rejecting, intellect becomes a part of the
processes, and is subjugated."
"You cannot do it?" Stilgar asked.
"Were I to seek Tupile with prescience," Paul said, speaking directly to
Irulan, "this might hide Tupile."
"Chaos!" Irulan protested. "It has no . . . no . . . consistency."
"I did say it obeys no Natural Law," Paul said.
"Then there are limits to what you can see or do with your powers?" Irulan
asked.
Before Paul could answer, Alia said: "Dear Irulan, prescience has no limits.
Not consistent? Consistency isn't a necessary aspect of the universe."
"But he said . . ."
"How can my brother give you explicit information about the limits of
something which has no limits? The boundaries escape the intellect."
That was a nasty thing for Alia to do, Paul thought. It would alarm Irulan,
who had such a careful consciousness, so dependent upon values derived from
precise limits. His gaze went to Korba, who sat in a pose of religious reverie - listening with the soul. How could the Qizarate use this exchange? More
religious mystery? Something to evoke awe? No doubt.
"Then you'll sign the treaty in its present form?" Stilgar asked.
Paul smiled. The issue of the oracle, by Stilgar's judgment, had been
closed. Stilgar aimed only at victory, not at discovering truth. Peace, justice
and a sound coinage -- these anchored Stilgar's universe. He wanted something
visible and real -- a signature on a treaty.
"I'll sign it," Paul said.
Stilgar took up a fresh folder. "The latest communication from our field
commanders in Sector Ixian speaks of agitation for a constitution." The old
Fremen glanced at Chani, who shrugged.
Irulan, who had closed her eyes and put both hands to her forehead in
mnemonic impressment, opened her eyes, studied Paul intently.
"The Ixian Confederacy offers submission," Stilgar said, "but their
negotiators question the amount of the Imperial Tax which they --"
"They want a legal limit to my Imperial will," Paul said. "Who would govern
me, the Landsraad or CHOAM?"
Stilgar removed from the folder a note on instroy paper. "One of our agents
sent this memorandum from a caucus of the CHOAM minority." He read the cipher in
a flat voice: "The Throne must be stopped in its attempt at a power monopoly. We
must tell the truth about the Atreides, how he maneuvers behind the triple sham
of Landsraad legislation, religious sanction and bureaucratic efficiency." He
pushed the note back into the folder.
"A constitution," Chani murmured.
Paul glanced at her, back to Stilgar. Thus the Jihad falters, Paul thought,
but not soon enough to save me. The thought produced emotional tensions. He
remembered his earliest visions of the Jihad-to-be, the terror and revulsion
he'd experienced. Now, of course, he knew visions of greater terrors. He had
lived with the real violence. He had seen his Fremen, charged with mystical
strength, sweep all before them in the religious war. The Jihad gained a new
perspective. It was finite, of course, a brief spasm when measured against
eternity, but beyond lay horrors to overshadow anything in the past.
All in my name, Paul thought.
"Perhaps they could be given the form of a constitution," Chani suggested.
"It needn't be actual."
"Deceit is a tool of statecraft," Irulan agreed.
"There are limits to power, as those who put their hopes in a constitution
always discover," Paul said.
Korba straightened from his reverent pose. "M'Lord?"
"Yes?" And Paul thought. Here now! Here's one who may harbor secret
sympathies for an imagined rule of Law.
"We could begin with a religious constitution," Korba said, "something for
the faithful who --"
"No!" Paul snapped. "We will make this an Order in Council. Are you
recording this, Irulan?"
"Yes, m'Lord," Irulan said, voice frigid with dislike for the menial role he
forced upon her.
"Constitutions become the ultimate tyranny," Paul said. "They're organized
power on such a scale as to be overwhelming. The constitution is social power
mobilized and it has no conscience. It can crush the highest and the lowest,
removing all dignity and individuality. It has an unstable balance point and no
limitations. I, however, have limitations. In my desire to provide an ultimate
protection for my people, I forbid a constitution. Order in Council, this date,
etcetera, etcetera."
"What of the Ixian concern about the tax, m'Lord?" Stilgar asked.
Paul forced his attention away from the brooding, angry look on Korba's
face, said: "You've a proposal, Stil?"
"We must have control of taxes, Sire."
"Our price to the Guild for my signature on the Tupile Treaty," Paul said,
"is the submission of the Ixian Confederacy to our tax. The Confederacy cannot
trade without Guild transport. They'll pay."
"Very good, m'Lord." Stilgar produced another folder, cleared his throat.
"The Qizarate's report on Salusa Secundus. Irulan's father has been putting his
legions through landing maneuvers."
Irulan found something of interest in the palm of her left hand. A pulse
throbbed at her neck.
"Irulan," Paul asked, "do you persist in arguing that your father's one
legion is nothing more than a toy?"
"What could he do with only one legion?" she asked. She stared at him out of
slitted eyes.
"He could get himself killed," Chani said.
Paul nodded. "And I'd be blamed."
"I know a few commanders in the Jihad," Alia said, "who'd pounce if they
learned of this."
"But it's only his police force!" Irulan protested.
"Then they have no need for landing maneuvers," Paul said. "I suggest that
your next little note to your father contain a frank and direct discussion of my
views about his delicate position."
She lowered her gaze. "Yes, m'Lord. I hope that will be the end of it. My
father would make a good martyr."
"Mmmmmm," Paul said. "My sister wouldn't send a message to those commanders
she mentioned unless I ordered it."
"An attack on my father carries dangers other than the obvious military
ones," Irulan said. "People are beginning to look back on his reign with a
certain nostalgia."
"You'll go too far one day," Chani said in her deadly serious Fremen voice.
"Enough!" Paul ordered.
He weighed Irulan's revelation about public nostalgia -- ah, now! that'd
carried a note of truth. Once more, Irulan had proved her worth.
"The Bene Gesserit send a formal supplication," Stilgar said, presenting
another folder. "They wish to consult you about the preservation of your
bloodline."
Chani glanced sideways at the folder as though it contained a deadly device.
"Send the Sisterhood the usual excuses," Paul said.
"Must we?" Irulan demanded.
"Perhaps . . . this is the time to discuss it," Chani said.
Paul shook his head sharply. They couldn't know that this was part of the
price he had not yet decided to pay.
But Chani wasn't to be stopped. "I have been to the prayer wall of Sietch
Tabr where I was born," she said. "I have submitted to doctors. I have knelt in
the desert and sent my thoughts into the depths where dwells Shai-hulud. Yet" -she shrugged -- "nothing avails."
Science and superstition, all have failed her, Paul thought. Do I fail her,
too, by not telling her what bearing an heir to House Atreides will precipitate?
He looked up to find an expression of pity in Alia's eyes. The idea of pity from
his sister repelled him. Had she, too, seen that terrifying future?
"My Lord must know the dangers to his realm when he has no heir," Irulan
said, using her Bene Gesserit powers of voice with an oily persuasiveness.
"These things are naturally difficult to discuss, but they must be brought into
the open. An Emperor is more than a man. His figure leads the realm. Should he
die without an heir, civil strife must follow. As you love your people, you
cannot leave them thus?"
Paul pushed himself away from the table, strode to the balcony windows. A
wind was flattening the smoke of the city's fires out there. The sky presented a
darkening silver-blue softened by the evening fall of dust from the Shield Wall.
He stared southward at the escarpment which protected his northern lands from
the coriolis wind, and he wondered why his own peace of mind could find no such
shield.
The Council sat silently waiting behind him, aware of how close to rage he
was.
Paul sensed time rushing upon him. He tried to force himself into a
tranquility of many balances where he might shape a new future.
Disengage . . . disengage . . . disengage, he thought. What would happen if
he took Chani, just picked up and left with her, sought sanctuary on Tupile? His
name would remain behind. The Jihad would find new and more terrible centers
upon which to turn. He'd be blamed for that, too. He felt suddenly fearful that
in reaching for any new thing he might let fall what was most precious, that
even the slightest noise from him might send the universe crashing back,
receding until he never could recapture any piece of it.
Below him, the square had become the setting for a band of pilgrims in the
green and white of the hajj. They wended their way like a disjointed snake
behind a striding Arrakeen guide. They reminded Paul that his reception hall
would be packed with supplicants by now. Pilgrims! Their exercise in
homelessness had become a disgusting source of wealth for his Imperium. The hajj
filled the spaceways with religious tramps. They came and they came and they
came.
How did I set this in motion? he asked himself.
It had, of course, set itself in motion. It was in the genes which might
labor for centuries to achieve this brief spasm.
Driven by that deepest religious instinct, the people came, seeking their
resurrection. The pilgrimage ended here -- "Arrakis, the place of rebirth, the
place to die."
Snide old Fremen said he wanted the pilgrims for their water.
What was it the pilgrims really sought? Paul wondered. They said they came
to a holy place. But they must know the universe contained no Eden-source, no
Tupile for the soul. They called Arrakis the place of the unknown where all
mysteries were explained. This was a link between their universe and the next.
And the frightening thing was that they appeared to go away satisfied.
What do they find here? Paul asked himself.
Often in their religious ecstasy, they filled the streets with screeching
like some odd aviary. In fact, the Fremen called them "passage birds." And the
few who died here were "winged souls."
With a sigh, Paul thought how each new planet his legions subjugated opened
new sources of pilgrims. They came out of gratitude for "the peace of Muad'dib."
Everywhere there is peace, Paul thought. Everywhere . . . except in the
heart of Muad'dib.
He felt that some element of himself lay immersed in frosty hoar-darkness
without end. His prescient power had tampered with the image of the universe
held by all mankind. He had shaken the safe cosmos and replaced security with
his Jihad. He had out-fought and out-thought and out-predicted the universe of
men, but a certainty filled him that this universe still eluded him.
This planet beneath him which he had commanded be remade from desert into a
water-rich paradise, it was alive. It had a pulse as dynamic as that of any
human. It fought him, resisted, slipped away from his commands . . .
A hand crept into Paul's. He looked down to see Chani peering up at him,
concern in her eyes. Those eyes drank him, and she whispered: "Please, love, do
not battle with your ruh-self." An outpouring of emotion swept upward from her
hand, buoyed him.
"Sihaya," he whispered.
"We must go to the desert soon," she said in a low voice.
He squeezed her hand, released it, returned to the table where he remained
standing.
Chani took her seat.
Irulan stared at the papers in front of Stilgar, her mouth a tight line.
"Irulan proposes herself as mother of the Imperial heir," Paul said. He
glanced at Chani, back to Irulan, who refused to meet his gaze. "We all know she
holds no love for me."
Irulan went very still.
"I know the political arguments," Paul said. "It's the human arguments which
concern me. I think if the Princess Consort were not bound by the commands of
the Bene Gesserit, if she did not seek this out of desires for personal power,
my reaction might be very different. As matters stand, though, I reject this
proposal."
Irulan took a deep, shaky breath.
Paul, resuming his seat, thought he had never seen her under such poor
control. Leaning toward her, he said: "Irulan, I am truly sorry."
She lifted her chin, a look of pure fury in her eyes. "I don't want your
pity!" she hissed. And turning to Stilgar: "Is there more that's urgent and
dire?"
Holding his gaze firmly on Paul, Stilgar said: "One more matter, m'Lord. The
Guild again proposes a formal embassy here on Arrakis."
"One of the deep-space kind?" Korba asked, his voice full of fanatic
loathing.
"Presumably," Stilgar said.
"A matter to be considered with the utmost care, m'Lord," Korba warned. "The
Council of Naibs would not like it, an actual Guildsman here on Arrakis. They
contaminate the very ground they touch."
"They live in tanks and don't touch the ground," Paul said, letting his
voice reveal irritation.
"The Naibs might take matters into their own hands, m'Lord," Korba said.
Paul glared at him.
"They are Fremen, after all, m'Lord," Korba insisted. "We well remember how
the Guild brought those who oppressed us. We have not forgotten the way they
blackmailed a spice ransom from us to keep our secrets from our enemies. They
drained us of every --"
"Enough!" Paul snapped. "Do you think I have forgotten?"
As though he had just awakened to the import of his own words, Korba
stuttered unintelligibly, then: "M'lord, forgive me. I did not mean to imply you
are not Fremen. I did not . . ."
"They'll send a Steersman," Paul said. "It isn't likely a Steersman would
come here if he could see danger in it."
Her mouth dry with sudden fear, Irulan said: "You've . . . seen a Steersman
come here?"
"Of course I haven't seen a Steersman," Paul said, mimicking her tone. "But
I can see where one's been and where one's going. Let them send us a Steersman.
Perhaps I have a use for such a one."
"So ordered," Stilgar said.
And Irulan, hiding a smile behind her hand, thought: It's true then. Our
Emperor cannot see a Steersman. They are mutually blind. The conspiracy is
hidden.

"Once more the drama begins."
-The Emperor Paul Muad'dib on his ascension to the Lion Throne
Alia peered down from her spy window into the great reception hall to watch
the advance of the Guild entourage.
The sharply silver light of noon poured through clerestory windows onto a
floor worked in green, blue and eggshell tiles to simulate a bayou with water
plants and, here and there, a splash of exotic color to indicate bird or animal.
Guildsmen moved across the tile pattern like hunters stalking their prey in
a strange jungle. They formed a moving design of gray robes, black robes, orange
robes -- all arrayed in a deceptively random way around the transparent tank
where the Steersman-Ambassador swam in his orange gas. The tank slid on its
supporting field, towed by two gray-robed attendants, like a rectangular ship
being warped into its dock.
Directly beneath her, Paul sat on the Lion Throne on its raised dais. He
wore the new formal crown with its fish and fist emblems. The jeweled golden
robes of state covered his body. The shimmering of a personal shield surrounded
him. Two wings of bodyguards fanned out on both sides along the dais and down
the steps. Stilgar stood two steps below Paul's right hand in a white robe with
a yellow rope for a belt.
Sibling empathy told her that Paul seethed with the same agitation she was
experiencing, although she doubted another could detect it. His attention
remained on an orange-robed attendant whose blindly staring metal eyes looked
neither to right nor to left. This attendant walked at the right front corner of
the Ambassador's troupe like a military outrider. A rather flat face beneath
curly black hair, such of his figure as could be seen beneath the orange robe,
every gesture shouted a familiar identity.
It was Duncan Idaho.
It could not be Duncan Idaho, yet it was.
Captive memories absorbed in the womb during the moment of her mother's
spice change identified this man for Alia by a rihani decipherment which cut
through all camouflage. Paul was seeing him, she knew, out of countless personal
experiences, out of gratitudes and youthful sharing.
It was Duncan.
Alia shuddered. There could be only one answer: this was a Tleilaxu ghola, a
being reconstructed from the dead flesh of the original. That original had
perished saving Paul. This could only be a product of the axolotl tanks.
The ghola walked with the cock-footed alertness of a master swordsman. He
came to a halt as the Ambassador's tank glided to a stop ten paces from the
steps of the dais.
In the Bene Gesserit way she could not escape, Alia read Paul's disquiet. He
no longer looked at the figure out of his past. Not looking, his whole being
stared. Muscles strained against restrictions as he nodded to the Guild
Ambassador, said: "I am told your name is Edric. We welcome you to our Court in
the hope this will bring new understanding between us."
The Steersman assumed a sybaritic reclining pose in his orange gas, popped a
melange capsule into his mouth before meeting Paul's gaze. The tiny transducer
orbiting a corner of the Guildsman's tank reproduced a coughing sound, then the
rasping, uninvolved voice: "I abase myself before my Emperor and beg leave to
present my credentials and offer a small gift."
An aide passed a scroll up to Stilgar, who studied it, scowling, then nodded
to Paul. Both Stilgar and Paul turned then toward the ghola standing patiently
below the dais.
"Indeed my Emperor has discerned the gift," Edric said.
"We are pleased to accept your credentials," Paul said. "Explain the gift."
Edric rolled in the tank, bringing his attention to bear on the ghola. "This
is a man called Hayt," he said, spelling the name. "According to our
investigators, he has a most curious history. He was killed here on Arrakis . .
. a grievous head-wound which required many months of regrowth. The body was
sold to the Bene Tleilax as that of a master swordsman, an adept of the Ginaz
School. It came to our attention that this must be Duncan Idaho, the trusted
retainer of your household. We bought him as a gift befitting an Emperor." Edric
peered up at Paul. "Is it not Idaho, Sire?"
Restraint and caution gripped Paul's voice. "He has the aspect of Idaho."
Does Paul see something I don't? Alia wondered. No! It's Duncan!
The man called Hayt stood impassively, metal eyes fixed straight ahead, body
relaxed. No sign escaped him to indicate he knew himself to be the object of
discussion.
"According to our best knowledge, it's Idaho," Edric said.
"He's called Hayt now," Paul said. "A curious name."
"Sire, there's no divining how or why the Tleilaxu bestow names," Edric
said. "But names can be changed. The Tleilaxu name is of little importance."
This is a Tleilaxu thing, Paul thought. There's the problem. The Bene
Tleilax held little attachment to phenomenal nature. Good and evil carried
strange meanings in their philosophy. What might they have incorporated in
Idaho's flesh -- out of design or whim?
Paul glanced at Stilgar, noted the Fremen's superstitious awe. It was an
emotion echoed all through his Fremen guard. Stilgar's mind would be speculating
about the loathsome habits of Guildsmen, of Tleilaxu and of gholas.
Turning toward the ghola, Paul said: "Hayt, is that your only name?"
A serene smile spread over the ghola's dark features. The metal eyes lifted,
centered on Paul, but maintained their mechanical stare. "That is how I am
called, my Lord: Hayt."
In her dark spy hole, Alia trembled. It was Idaho's voice, a quality of
sound so precise she sensed its imprint upon her cells.
"May it please my Lord," the ghola added, "if I say his voice gives me
pleasure. This is a sign, say the Bene Tleilax, that I have heard the voice . .
. before."
"But you don't know this for sure," Paul said.
"I know nothing of my past for sure, my Lord. It was explained that I can
have no memory of my former life. All that remains from before is the pattern
set by the genes. There are, however, niches into which once familiar things may
fit. There are voices, places, foods, faces, sounds, actions -- a sword in my
hand, the controls of a 'thopter . . . "
Noting how intently the Guildsmen watched this exchange, Paul asked: "Do you
understand that you're a gift?"
"It was explained to me, my Lord."
Paul sat back, hands resting on the arms of the throne.
What debt do I owe Duncan's flesh? he wondered. The man died saving my life.
But this is not Idaho, this is a ghola. Yet, here were body and mind which had
taught Paul to fly a 'thopter as though the wings grew from his own shoulders.
Paul knew he could not pick up a sword without leaning on the harsh education
Idaho had given him. A ghola. This was flesh full of false impressions, easily
misread. Old associations would persist. Duncan Idaho. It wasn't so much a mask
the ghola wore as it was a loose, concealing garment of personality which moved
in a way different from whatever the Tleilaxu had hidden here.
"How might you serve us?" Paul asked.
"In any way my Lord's wishes and my capabilities agree."
Alia, watching from her vantage point, was touched by the ghola's air of
diffidence. She detected nothing feigned. Something ultimately innocent shone
from the new Duncan Idaho. The original had been worldly, devil-may-care. But
this flesh had been cleansed of all that. It was a pure surface upon which the
Tleilaxu had written . . . what?

She sensed the hidden perils in this gift then. This was a Tleilaxu thing.
The Tleilaxu displayed a disturbing lack of inhibitions in what they created.
Unbridled curiosity might guide their actions. They boasted they could make
anything from the proper human raw material -- devils or saints. They sold
killer-mentats. They'd produced a killer medic, overcoming the Suk inhibitions
against the taking of human life to do it. Their wares included willing menials,
pliant sex toys for any whim, soldiers, generals, philosophers, even an
occasional moralist.
Paul stirred, looked at Edric. "How has this gift been trained?" he asked.
"If it please my Lord," Edric said, "it amused the Tleilaxu to train this
ghola as a mentat and philosopher of the Zensunni. Thus, they sought to increase
his abilities with the sword."
"Did they succeed?"
"I do not know, my Lord."
Paul weighed the answer. Truthsense told him Edric sincerely believed the
ghola to be Idaho. But there was more. The waters of Time through which this
oracular Steersman moved suggested dangers without revealing them. Hayt. The
Tleilaxu name spoke of peril. Paul felt himself tempted to reject the gift. Even
as he felt the temptation, he knew he couldn't choose that way. This flesh made
demands on House Atreides -- a fact the enemy well knew.
"Zensunni philosopher," Paul mused, once more looking at the ghola. "You've
examined your own role and motives?"
"I approach my service in an attitude of humility, Sire. I am a cleansed
mind washed free of the imperatives from my human past."
"Would you prefer we called you Hayt or Duncan Idaho?"
"My Lord may call me what he wishes, for I am not a name."
"But do you enjoy the name Duncan Idaho?"
"I think that was my name, Sire. It fits within me. Yet . . . it stirs up
curious responses. One's name, I think, must carry much that's unpleasant along
with the pleasant."
"What gives you the most pleasure?" Paul asked.
Unexpectedly, the ghola laughed, said: "Looking for signs in others which
reveal my former self."
"Do you see such signs here?"
"Oh, yes, my Lord. Your man Stilgar there is caught between suspicion and
admiration. He was friend to my former self, but this ghola flesh repels him.
You, my Lord, admired the man I was . . . and you trusted him."
"Cleansed mind," Paul said. "How can a cleansed mind put itself in bondage
to us?"
"Bondage, my Lord? The cleansed mind makes decisions in the presence of
unknowns and without cause and effect. Is this bondage?"
Paul scowled. It was a Zensunni saying, cryptic, apt -- immersed in a creed
which denied objective function in all mental activity. Without cause and
effect! Such thoughts shocked the mind. Unknowns? Unknowns lay in every
decision, even in the oracular vision.
"You'd prefer we called you Duncan Idaho?" Paul asked.
"We live by differences, my Lord. Choose a name for me."
"Let your Tleilaxu name stand," Paul said. "Hayt -- there's a name inspires
caution."
Hayt bowed, moved back one step.
And Alia wondered: How did he know the interview was over? I knew it because
I know my brother. But there was no sign a stranger could read. Did the Duncan
Idaho in him know?
Paul turned toward the Ambassador, said: "Quarters have been set aside for
your embassy. It is our desire to have a private consultation with you at the
earliest opportunity. We will send for you. Let us inform you further, before
you hear it from an inaccurate source, that a Reverend Mother of the Sisterhood,
Gaius Helen Mohiam, has been removed from the heighliner which brought you. It
was done at our command. Her presence on your ship will be an item in our
talks."
A wave of Paul's left hand dismissed the envoy. "Hayt," Paul said, "stay
here."
The Ambassador's attendants backed away, towing the tank. Edric became
orange motion in orange gas -- eyes, a mouth, gently waving limbs.
Paul watched until the last Guildsman was gone, the great doors swinging
closed behind them.
I've done it now, Paul thought. I've accepted the ghola. The Tleilaxu
creation was bait, no doubt of it. Very likely the old hag of a Reverend Mother
played the same role. But it was the time of the tarot which he'd forecast in an
early vision. The damnable tarot! It muddied the waters of Time until the
prescient strained to detect moments but an hour off. Many a fish took the bait
and escaped, he reminded himself. And the tarot worked for him as well as
against him. What he could not see, others might not detect as well.
The ghola stood, head cocked to one side, waiting.
Stilgar moved across the steps, hid the ghola from Paul's view. In Chakobsa,
the hunting language of their sietch days, Stilgar said: "That creature in the
tank gives me the shudders, Sire, but this gift! Send it away!"
In the same tongue, Paul said: "I cannot."
"Idaho's dead," Stilgar argued. "This isn't Idaho. Let me take its water for
the tribe."
"The ghola is my problem, Stil. Your problem is our prisoner. I want the
Reverend Mother guarded most carefully by the men I trained to resist the wiles
of Voice."
"I like this not, Sire."
"I'll be cautious, Stil. See that you are, too."
"Very well, Sire." Stilgar stepped down to the floor of the hall, passed
close to Hayt, sniffed him and strode out.
Evil can be detected by its smell, Paul thought. Stilgar had planted the
green and white Atreides banner on a dozen worlds, but remained superstitious
Fremen, proof against any sophistication.
Paul studied the gift.
"Duncan, Duncan," he whispered. "What have they done to you?"
"They gave me life, m'Lord," Hayt said.
"But why were you trained and given to us?" Paul asked.
Hayt pursed his lips, then: "They intend me to destroy you."
The statement's candor shook Paul. But then, how else could a Zensunnimentat respond? Even in a ghola, a mentat could speak no less than the truth,
especially out of Zensunni inner calm. This was a human computer, mind and
nervous system fitted to the tasks relegated long ago to hated mechanical
devices. To condition him also as a Zensunni meant a double ration of honesty .
. . unless the Tleilaxu had built something even more odd into this flesh.
Why, for example, the mechanical eyes? Tleilaxu boasted their metal eyes
improved on the original. Strange, then, that more Tleilaxu didn't wear them out
of choice.
Paul glanced up at Alia's spy hole, longed for her presence and advice, for
counsel not clouded by feelings of responsibility and debt.
Once more, he looked at the ghola. This was no frivolous gift. It gave
honest answers to dangerous questions.
It makes no difference that I know this is a weapon to be used against me,
Paul thought.
"What should I do to protect myself from you?" Paul asked. It was direct
speech, no royal "we," but a question as he might have put it to the old Duncan
Idaho.
"Send me away, m'Lord."
Paul shook his head from side to side. "How are you to destroy me?"
Hayt looked at the guards, who'd moved closer to Paul after Stilgar's
departure. He turned, cast his gaze around the hall, brought his metal eyes back
to bear on Paul, nodded.
"This is a place where a man draws away from people," Hayt said. "It speaks
of such power that one can contemplate it comfortably only in the remembrance
that all things are finite. Did my Lord's oracular powers plot his course into
this place?"
Paul drummed his fingers against the throne's arms. The mentat sought data,
but the question disturbed him. "I came to this position by strong decisions . .
. not always out of my other . . . abilities."
"Strong decisions," Hayt said. "These temper a man's life. One can take the
temper from fine metal by heating it and allowing it to cool without quenching."
"Do you divert me with Zensunni prattle?" Paul asked.
"Zensunni has other avenues to explore, Sire, than diversion and display."
Paul wet his lips with his tongue, drew in a deep breath, set his own
thoughts into the counterbalance poise of the mentat. Negative answers arose
around him. It wasn't expected that he'd go haring after the ghola to the
exclusion of other duties. No, that wasn't it. Why a Zensunni-mentat? Philosophy
. . . words . . . contemplation . . . inward searching . . . He felt the
weakness of his data.
"We need more data," he muttered.
"The facts needed by a mentat do not brush off onto one as you might gather
pollen on your robe while passing through a field of flowers," Hayt said. "One
chooses his pollen carefully, examines it under powerful amplification."
"You must teach me this Zensunni way with rhetoric," Paul said.
The metallic eyes glittered at him for a moment, then: "M'Lord, perhaps
that's what was intended."
To blunt my will with words and ideas? Paul wondered.
"Ideas are most to feared when they become actions," Paul said.
"Send me away, Sire," Hayt said, and it was Duncan Idaho's voice full of
concern for "the young master."
Paul felt trapped by that voice. He couldn't send that voice away, even when
it came from a ghola. "You will stay," he said, "and we'll both exercise
caution."
Hayt bowed in submission.
Paul glanced up at the spy hole, eyes pleading for Alia to take this gift
off his hands and ferret out its secrets. Gholas were ghosts to frighten
children. He'd never thought to know one. To know this one, he had to set
himself above all compassion . . . and he wasn't certain he could do it. Duncan
. . . Duncan . . . Where was Idaho in this shaped-to-measure flesh? It wasn't
flesh . . . it was a shroud in fleshly shape! Idaho lay dead forever on the
floor of an Arrakeen cavern. His ghost stared out of metal eyes. Two beings
stood side by side in this revenant flesh. One was a threat with its force and
nature hidden behind unique veils.
Closing his eyes, Paul allowed old visions to sift through his awareness. He
sensed the spirits of love and hate spouting there in a rolling sea from which
no rock lifted above the chaos. No place at all from which to survey turmoil.
Why has no vision shown me this new Duncan Idaho? he asked himself. What
concealed Time from an oracle? Other oracles, obviously.
Paul opened his eyes, asked: "Hayt, do you have the power of prescience?"
"No, m'Lord."
Sincerity spoke in that voice. It was possible the ghola didn't know he
possessed this ability, of course. But that'd hamper his working as a mentat.
What was the hidden design?

Old visions surged around Paul. Would he have to choose the terrible way?
Distorted Time hinted at this ghola in that hideous future. Would that way close
in upon him no matter what he did?
Disengage . . . disengage . . . disengage . . .
The thought tolled in his mind.
In her position above Paul, Alia sat with chin cupped in left hand, stared
down at the ghola. A magnetic attraction about this Hayt reached up to her.
Tleilaxu restoration had given him youth, an innocent intensity which called out
to her. She'd understood Paul's unspoken plea. When oracles failed, one turned
to real spies and physical powers. She wondered, though, at her own eagerness to
accept this challenge. She felt a positive desire to be near this new man,
perhaps to touch him.
He's a danger to both of us, she thought.

Truth suffers from too much analysis.
-Ancient Fremen Saying
"Reverend Mother, I shudder to see you in such circumstances," Irulan said.
She stood just inside the cell door, measuring the various capacities of the
room in her Bene Gesserit way. It was a three-meter cube carved with cutterays
from the veined brown rock beneath Paul's Keep. For furnishings, it contained
one flimsy basket chair occupied now by the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam,
a pallet with a brown cover upon which had been spread a deck of the new Dune
Tarot cards, a metered water tap above a reclamation basin, a Fremen privy with
moisture seals. It was all sparse, primitive. Yellow light came from anchored
and caged glowglobes at the four corners of the ceiling.
"You've sent word to the Lady Jessica?" the Reverend Mother asked.
"Yes, but I don't expect her to lift one finger against her firstborn,"
Irulan said. She glanced at the cards. They spoke of the powerful turning their
backs on supplicants. The card of the Great Worm lay beneath Desolate Sand.
Patience was counseled. Did one require the tarot to see this? she asked
herself.
A guard stood outside watching them through a metaglass window in the door.
Irulan knew there'd be other monitors on this encounter. She had put in much
thought and planning before daring to come here. To have stayed away carried its
own perils, though.
The Reverend Mother had been engaged in prajna meditation interspersed with
examinations of the tarot. Despite a feeling that she would never leave Arrakis
alive, she had achieved a measure of calm through this. One's oracular powers
might be small, but muddy water was muddy water. And there was always the Litany
Against Fear.
She had yet to assimilate the import of the actions which had precipitated
her into this cell. Dark suspicions brooded in her mind (and the tarot hinted at
confirmations). Was it possible the Guild had planned this?
A yellow-robed Qizara, head shaved for a turban, beady eyes of total blue in
a bland round face, skin leathered by the wind and sun of Arrakis, had awaited
her on the heighliner's reception bridge. He had looked up from a bulb of spicecoffee being served by an obsequious steward, studied her a moment, put down the
coffee bulb.
"You are the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam?"
To replay those words in her mind was to bring that moment alive in the
memory. Her throat had constricted with an unmanageable spasm of fear. How had
one of the Emperor's minions learned of her presence on the heighliner?
"It came to our attention that you were aboard," the Qizara said. "Have you
forgotten that you are denied permission to set foot on the holy planet?"
"I am not on Arrakis," she said. "I'm a passenger on a Guild heighliner in
free space."
"There is no such thing as free space, Madame."
She read hate mingled with profound suspicion in his tone.
"Muad'dib rules everywhere," he said.
"Arrakis is not my destination," she insisted.
"Arrakis is the destination of everyone," he said. And she feared for a
moment that he would launch into a recital of the mystical itinerary which
pilgrims followed. (This very ship had carried thousands of them.)
But the Qizara had pulled a golden amulet from beneath his robe, kissed it,
touched it to his forehead and placed it to his right ear, listened. Presently,
he restored the amulet to its hidden place.
"You are ordered to gather your luggage and accompany me to Arrakis."
"But I have business elsewhere!"
In that moment, she suspected Guild perfidy . . . or exposure through some
transcendent power of the Emperor or his sister. Perhaps the Steersman did not
conceal the conspiracy, after all. The abomination, Alia, certainly possessed
the abilities of a Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother. What happened when those
powers were coupled with the forces which worked in her brother?
"At once!" the Qizara snapped.
Everything in her cried out against setting foot once more on that accursed
desert planet. Here was where the Lady Jessica had turned against the
Sisterhood. Here was where they'd lost Paul Atreides, the kwisatz haderach
they'd sought through long generations of careful breeding.
"At once," she agreed.
"There's little time," the Qizara said. "When the Emperor commands, all his
subjects obey."
So the order had come from Paul!
She thought of protesting to the heighliner's Navigator-Commander, but the
futility of such a gesture stopped her. What could the Guild do?
"The Emperor has said I must die if I set foot on Dune," she said, making a
last desperate effort. "You spoke of this yourself. You are condemning me if you
take me down there."
"Say no more," the Qizara ordered. "The thing is ordained."
That was how they always spoke of Imperial commands, she knew. Ordained! The
holy ruler whose eyes could pierce the future had spoken. What must be must be.
He had seen it, had He not?
With the sick feeling that she was caught in a web of her own spinning, she
had turned to obey.
And the web had become a cell which Irulan could visit. She saw that Irulan
had aged somewhat since their meeting on Wallach IX. New lines of worry spread
from the corners of her eyes. Well . . . time to see if this Sister of the Bene
Gesserit could obey her vows.
"I've had worse quarters," the Reverend Mother said. "Do you come from the
Emperor?" And she allowed her fingers to move as though in agitation.
Irulan read the moving fingers and her own fingers flashed an answer as she
spoke, saying: "No -- I came as soon as I heard you were here."
"Won't the Emperor be angry?" the Reverend Mother asked. Again, her fingers
moved: imperative, pressing, demanding.
"Let him be angry. You were my teacher in the Sisterhood, just as you were
the teacher of his own mother. Does he think I will turn my back on you as she
has done?" And Irulan's finger-talk made excuses, begged.
The Reverend Mother sighed. On the surface, it was the sigh of a prisoner
bemoaning her fate, but inwardly she felt the response as a comment on Irulan.
It was futile to hope the Atreides Emperor's precious gene pattern could be
preserved through this instrument. No matter her beauty, this Princess was
flawed. Under that veneer of sexual attraction lived a whining shrew more
interested in words than in actions. Irulan was still a Bene Gesserit, though,
and the Sisterhood reserved certain techniques to use on some of its weaker
vessels as insurance that vital instructions would be carried out.
Beneath small talk about a softer pallet, better food, the Reverend Mother
brought up her arsenal of persuasion and gave her orders: the brother-sister
crossbreeding must be explored. (Irulan almost broke at receiving this command.)
"I must have my chance!" Irulan's fingers pleaded.
"You've had your chance," the Reverend Mother countered. And she was
explicit in her instructions: Was the Emperor ever angry with his concubine? His
unique powers must make him lonely. To whom could he speak in any hope of being
understood? To the sister, obviously. She shared this loneliness. The depth of
their communion must be exploited. Opportunities must be created to throw them
together in privacy. Intimate encounters must be arranged. The possibility of
eliminating the concubine must be explored. Grief dissolved traditional
barriers.
Irulan protested. If Chani were killed, suspicion would fasten immediately
upon the Princess-Consort. Besides, there were other problems. Chani had
fastened upon an ancient Fremen diet supposed to promote fertility and the diet
eliminated all opportunity for administering the contraceptive drugs. Lifting
the suppressives would make Chani even more fertile.
The Reverend Mother was outraged and concealed it with difficulty while her
fingers flashed their demands. Why had this information not been conveyed at the
beginning of their conversation? How could Irulan be that stupid? If Chani
conceived and bore a son, the Emperor would declare the child his heir!
Irulan protested that she understood the dangers, but the genes might not be
totally lost.
Damn such stupidity! the Reverend Mother raged. Who knew what suppressions
and genetic entanglements Chani might introduce from her wild Fremen strain? The
Sisterhood must have only the pure line! And an heir would renew Paul's
ambitions, spur him to new efforts in consolidating his Empire. The conspiracy
could not afford such a setback.
Defensively, Irulan wanted to know how she could have prevented Chani from
trying this diet?
But the Reverend Mother was in no mood for excuses. Irulan received explicit
instructions now to meet this new threat. If Chani conceived, an abortifact must
be introduced into her food or drink. Either that, or she must be killed. An
heir to the throne from that source must be prevented at all costs.
An abortifact would be as dangerous as an open attack on the concubine.
Irulan objected. She trembled at the thought of trying to kill Chani.
Was Irulan deterred by danger? The Reverend Mother wanted to know, her
finger-talk conveying deep scorn.
Angered, Irulan signaled that she knew her value as an agent in the royal
household. Did the conspiracy wish to waste such a valuable agent? Was she to be
thrown away? In what other way could they keep this close a watch on the
Emperor? Or had they introduced another agent into the household? Was that it?
Was she to be used now, desperately, and for the last time?
In a war, all values acquired new relationships, the Reverend Mother
countered. Their greatest peril was that House Atreides should secure itself
with an Imperial line. The Sisterhood could not take such a risk. This went far
beyond the danger to the Atreides genetic pattern. Let Paul anchor his family to
the throne and the Sisterhood could look forward to centuries of disruption for
its programs.
Irulan understood the argument, but she couldn't escape the thought that a
decision had been made to spend the Princess-Consort for something of great
value. Was there something she should know about the ghola? Irulan ventured.
The Reverend Mother wanted to know if Irulan thought the Sisterhood composed
of fools. When had they ever failed to tell Irulan all she should know?

It was no answer, but an admission of concealment, Irulan saw. It said she
would be told no more than she needed to know.
How could they be certain the ghola was capable of destroying the Emperor?
Irulan asked.
She could just as well have asked if melange were capable of destruction,
the Reverend Mother countered.
It was a rebuke with a subtle message, Irulan realized. The Bene Gesserit
"whip that instructs" informed her that she should have understood long ago this
similarity between the spice and the ghola. Melange was valuable, but it exacted
a price -- addiction. It added years to a life -- decades for some -- but it was
still just another way to die.
The ghola was something of deadly value.
The obvious way to prevent an unwanted birth was to kill the prospective
mother before conception, the Reverend Mother signaled, returning to the attack.
Of course, Irulan thought. If you decide to spend a certain sum, get as much
for it as you can.
The Reverend Mother's eyes, dark with the blue brilliance of her melange
addiction, stared up at Irulan, measuring, waiting, observing minutiae.
She reads me clearly, Irulan thought with dismay. She trained me and
observed me in that training. She knows I realize what decision has been taken
here. She only observes now to see how I will take this knowledge. Well, I will
take it as a Bene Gesserit and a princess.
Irulan managed a smile, pulled herself erect, thought of the evocative
opening passage of the Litany Against Fear:
"I must not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. Fear is the little-death that
brings total obliteration. I will face my fear . . . "
When calmness had returned, she thought: Let them spend me. I will show them
what a princess is worth. Perhaps I'll buy them more than they expected.
After a few more empty vocalizations to bind off the interview. Irulan
departed.
When she had gone, the Reverend Mother returned to her tarot cards, laying
them out in the fire-eddy pattern. Immediately, she got the Kwisatz Haderach of
the Major Arcana and the card lay coupled with the Eight of Ships: the sibyl
hoodwinked and betrayed. These were not cards of good omen: they spoke of
concealed resources for her enemies.
She turned away from the cards, sat in agitation, wondering if Irulan might
yet destroy them.

The Fremen see her as the Earth Figure, a demigoddess whose special charge is to
protect the tribes through her powers of violence. She is Reverend Mother to
their Reverend Mothers. To pilgrims who seek her out with demands that she
restore virility or make the barren fruitful, she is a form of antimentat. She
feeds on that proof that the "analytic" has limits. She represents ultimate
tension. She is the virgin-harlot -- witty, vulgar, cruel, as destructive in her
whims as a coriolis storm.
-St. Alia of the Knife as taken from The Irulan Report
Alia stood like a black-robed sentinel figure on the south platform of her
temple, the Fane of the Oracle which Paul's Fremen cohorts had built for her
against a wall of his stronghold.
She hated this part of her life, but knew no way to evade the temple without
bringing down destruction upon them all. The pilgrims (damn them!) grew more
numerous every day. The temple's lower porch was crowded with them. Vendors
moved among the pilgrims, and there were minor sorcerers, haruspices, diviners,
all working their trade in pitiful imitation of Paul Muad'dib and his sister.

Red and green packages containing the new Dune Tarot were prominent among
the vendors' wares, Alia saw. She wondered about the tarot. Who was feeding this
device into the Arrakeen market? Why had the tarot sprung to prominence at this
particular time and place? Was it to muddy Time? Spice addiction always conveyed
some sensitivity to prediction. Fremen were notoriously fey. Was it an accident
that so many of them dabbled in portents and omens here and now? She decided to
seek an answer at the first opportunity.
There was a wind from the southeast, a small leftover wind blunted by the
scarp of the Shield Wall which loomed high in these northern reaches. The rim
glowed orange through a thin dust haze underlighted by the late afternoon sun.
It was a hot wind against her cheeks and it made her homesick for the sand, for
the security of open spaces.
The last of the day's mob began descending the broad greenstone steps of the
lower porch, singly and in groups, a few pausing to stare at the keepsakes and
holy amulets on the street vendors' racks, some consulting one last minor
sorcerer. Pilgrims, supplicants, townfolk, Fremen, vendors closing up for the
day -- they formed a straggling line that trailed off into the palm-lined avenue
which led to the heart of the city.
Alia's eyes picked out the Fremen, marking the frozen looks of superstitious
awe on their faces, the half-wild way they kept their distance from the others.
They were her strength and her peril. They still captured giant worms for
transport, for sport and for sacrifice. They resented the offworld pilgrims,
barely tolerated the townfolk of graben and pan, hated the cynicism they saw in
the street vendors. One did not jostle a wild Fremen, even in a mob such as the
ones which swarmed to Alia's Fane. There were no knifings in the Sacred
Precincts, but bodies had been found . . . later.
The departing swarm had stirred up dust. The flinty odor came to Alia's
nostrils, ignited another pang of longing for the open bled. Her sense of the
past, she realized, had been sharpened by the coming of the ghola. There'd been
much pleasure in those untrammeled days before her brother had mounted the
throne -- time for joking, time for small things, time to enjoy a cool morning
or a sunset, time . . . time . . . time . . . Even danger had been good in those
days -- clean danger from known sources. No need then to strain the limits of
prescience, to peer through murky veils for frustrating glimpses of the future.
Wild Fremen said it well: "Four things cannot be hidden -- love, smoke, a
pillar of fire and a man striding across the open bled."
With an abrupt feeling of revulsion, Alia retreated from the platform into
the shadows of the Fane, strode along the balcony which looked down into the
glistening opalescence of her Hall of Oracles. Sand on the tiles rasped beneath
her feet. Supplicants always tracked sand into the Sacred Chambers! She ignored
attendants, guards, postulants, the Qizarate's omnipresent priest-sycophants,
plunged into the spiral passage which twisted upward to her private quarters.
There, amidst divans, deep rugs, tent hangings and mementos of the desert, she
dismissed the Fremen amazons Stilgar had assigned as her personal guardians.
Watchdogs, more likely! When they had gone, muttering and objecting, but more
fearful of her than they were of Stilgar, she stripped off her robe, leaving
only the sheathed crysknife on its thong around her neck, strewed garments
behind as she made for the bath.
He was near, she knew -- that shadow-figure of a man she could sense in her
future, but could not see. It angered her that no power of prescience could put
flesh on that figure. He could be sensed only at unexpected moments while she
scanned the lives of others. Or she came upon a smoky outline in solitary
darkness when innocence lay coupled with desire. He stood just beyond an unfixed
horizon, and she felt that if she strained her talents to an unexpected
intensity she might see him. He was there -- a constant assault on her
awareness: fierce, dangerous, immoral.

Moist warm air surrounded her in the tub. Here was a habit she had learned
from the memory-entities of the uncounted Reverend Mothers who were strung out
in her awareness like pearls on a glowing necklace. Water, warm water in a
sunken tub, accepted her skin as she slid into it. Green tiles with figures of
red fish worked into a sea pattern surrounded the water. Such an abundance of
water occupied this space that a Fremen of old would have been outraged to see
it used merely for washing human flesh.
He was near.
It was lust in tension with chastity, she thought. Her flesh desired a mate.
Sex held no casual mystery for a Reverend Mother who had presided at the sietch
orgies. The tau awareness of her other-selves could supply any detail her
curiosity required. This feeling of nearness could be nothing other than flesh
reaching for flesh.
Need for action fought lethargy in the warm water.
Abruptly, Alia climbed dripping from the bath, strode wet and naked into the
training chamber which adjoined her bedroom. The chamber, oblong and skylighted,
contained the gross and subtle instruments which toned a Bene Gesserit adept
into ultimate physical and mental awareness / preparedness. There were mnemonic
amplifiers, digit mills from lx to strengthen and sensitize fingers and toes,
odor synthesizers, tactility sensitizers, temperature gradient fields, pattern
betrayers to prevent her falling into detectable habits, alpha-wave-response
trainers, blink-synchronizers to tone abilities in light / dark / spectrum
analysis . . .
In ten-centimeter letters along one wall, written by her own hand in
mnemonic paint, stood the key reminder from the Bene Gesserit Creed:
"Before us, all methods of learning were tainted by instinct. We learned how
to learn. Before us, instinct-ridden researchers possessed a limited attention
span -- often no longer than a single lifetime. Projects stretching across fifty
or more lifetimes never occurred to them. The concept of total muscle / nerve
training had not entered awareness."
As she moved into the training room, Alia caught her own reflection
multiplied thousands of times in the crystal prisms of a fencing mirror swinging
in the heart of a target dummy. She saw the long sword waiting on its brackets
against the target, and she thought: Yes! I'll work myself to exhaustion -drain the flesh and clear the mind.
The sword felt right in her hand. She slipped the crysknife from its sheath
at her neck, held it sinister, tapped the activating stud with the sword tip.
Resistance came alive as the aura of the target shield built up, pushing her
weapon slowly and firmly away.
Prisms glittered. The target slipped to her left.
Alia followed with the tip of the long blade, thinking as she often did that
the thing could almost be alive. But it was only servomotors and complex
reflector circuits designed to lure the eyes away from danger, to confuse and
teach. It was an instrument geared to react as she reacted, an anti-self which
moved as she moved, balancing light on its prisms, shifting its target, offering
its counter-blade.
Many blades appeared to lunge at her from the prisms, but only one was real.
She countered the real one, slipped the sword past shield resistance to tap the
target. A marker light came alive: red and glistening among the prisms . . .
more distraction.
Again the thing attacked, moving at one-marker speed now, just a bit faster
than it had at the beginning.
She parried and, against all caution, moved into the danger zone, scored
with the crysknife.
Two lights glowed from the prisms.
Again, the thing increased speed, moving out on its rollers, drawn like a
magnet to the motions of her body and the tip of her sword.

Attack -- parry -- counter.
Attack -- parry -- counter . . .
She had four lights alive in there now, and the thing was becoming more
dangerous, moving faster with each light, offering more areas of confusion.
Five lights.
Sweat glistened on her naked skin. She existed now in a universe whose
dimensions were outlined by the threatening blade, the target, bare feet against
the practice floor, senses / nerves / muscles -- motion against motion.
Attack -- parry -- counter.
Six lights . . . seven . . .
Eight!
She had never before risked eight.
In a recess of her mind there grew a sense of urgency, a crying out against
such wildness as this. The instrument of prisms and target could not think, feel
caution or remorse. And it carried a real blade. To go against less defeated the
purpose of such training. That attacking blade could maim and it could kill. But
the finest swordsmen in the Imperium never went against more than seven lights.
Nine!
Alia experienced a sense of supreme exaltation. Attacking blade and target
became blurs among blurs. She felt that the sword in her hand had come alive.
She was an anti-target. She did not move the blade; it moved her.
Ten!
Eleven!
Something flashed past her shoulder, slowed at the shield aura around the
target, slid through and tripped the deactivating stud. The lights darkened.
Prisms and target twisted their way to stillness.
Alia whirled, angered by the intrusion, but her reaction was thrown into
tension by awareness of the supreme ability which had hurled that knife. It had
been a throw timed to exquisite nicety -- just fast enough to get through the
shield zone and not too fast to be deflected.
And it had touched a one-millimeter spot within an eleven-light target.
Alia found her own emotions and tensions running down in a manner not unlike
that of the target dummy. She was not at all surprised to see who had thrown the
knife.
Paul stood just inside the training room doorway, Stilgar three steps behind
him. Her brother's eyes were squinted in anger.
Alia, growing conscious of her nudity, thought to cover herself, found the
idea amusing. What the eyes had seen could not be erased. Slowly, she replaced
the crysknife in its sheath at her neck.
"I might've known," she said.
"I presume you know how dangerous that was," Paul said. He took his time
reading the reactions on her face and body: the flush of her exertions coloring
her skin, the wet fullness of her lips. There was a disquieting femaleness about
her that he had never considered in his sister. He found it odd that he could
look at a person who was this close to him and no longer recognize her in the
identity framework which had seemed so fixed and familiar.
"That was madness," Stilgar rasped, coming up to stand beside Paul.
The words were angry, but Alia heard awe in his voice, saw it in his eyes.
"Eleven lights," Paul said, shaking his head.
"I'd have made it twelve if you hadn't interfered," she said. She began, to
pale under his close regard, added: "And why do the damned things have that many
lights if we're not supposed to try for them?"
"A Bene Gesserit should ask the reasoning behind an open-ended system?" Paul
asked.
"I suppose you never tried for more than seven!" she said, anger returning.
His attentive posture began to annoy her.

"Just once," Paul said. "Gurney Halleck caught me on ten. My punishment was
sufficiently embarrassing that I won't tell you what he did. And speaking of
embarrassment . . . "
"Next time, perhaps you'll have yourselves announced," she said. She brushed
past Paul into the bedroom, found a loose gray robe, slipped into it, began
brushing her hair before a wall mirror. She felt sweaty, sad, a post-coitus kind
of sadness that left her with a desire to bathe once more . . . and to sleep.
"Why're you here?" she asked.
"My Lord," Stilgar said. There was an odd inflection in his voice that
brought Alia around to stare at him.
"We're here at Irulan's suggestion," Paul said, "as strange as that may
seem. She believes, and information in Stil's possession appears to confirm it,
that our enemies are about to make a major try for -- "
"My Lord!" Stilgar said, his voice sharper.
As her brother turned, questioning, Alia continued to look at the old Fremen
Naib. Something about him now made her intensely aware that he was one of the
primitives. Stilgar believed in a supernatural world very near him. It spoke to
him in a simple pagan tongue dispelling all doubts. The natural universe in
which he stood was fierce, unstoppable, and it lacked the common morality of the
Imperium.
"Yes, Stil," Paul said. "Do you want to tell her why we came?"
"This isn't the time to talk of why we came," Stilgar said.
"What's wrong, Stil?"
Stilgar continued to stare at Alia. "Sire, are you blind?"
Paul turned back to his sister, a feeling of unease beginning to fill him.
Of all his aides, only Stilgar dared speak to him in that tone, but even Stilgar
measured the occasion by its need.
"This one must have a mate!" Stilgar blurted. "There'll be trouble if she's
not wed, and that soon."
Alia whirled away, her face suddenly hot. How did he touch me? she wondered.
Bene Gesserit self-control had been powerless to prevent her reaction. How had
Stilgar done that? He hadn't the power of the Voice. She felt dismayed and
angry.
"Listen to the great Stilgar!" Alia said, keeping her back to them, aware of
a shrewish quality in her voice and unable to hide it. "Advice to maidens from
Stilgar, the Fremen!"
"As I love you both, I must speak," Stilgar said, a profound dignity in his
tone. "I did not become a chieftain among the Fremen by being blind to what
moves men and women together. One needs no mysterious powers for this."
Paul weighed Stilgar's meaning, reviewed what they had seen here and his own
undeniable male reaction to his own sister. Yes -- there'd been a ruttish air
about Alia, something wildly wanton. What had made her enter the practice floor
in the nude? And risking her life in that foolhardy way! Eleven lights in the
fencing prisms! That brainless automaton loomed in his mind with all the aspects
of an ancient horror creature. Its possession was the shibboleth of this age,
but it carried also the taint of old immorality. Once, they'd been guided by an
artificial intelligence, computer brains. The Butlerian Jihad had ended that,
but it hadn't ended the aura of aristocratic vice which enclosed such things.
Stilgar was right, of course. They must find a mate for Alia.
"I will see to it," Paul said. "Alia and I will discuss this later -privately."
Alia turned around, focused on Paul. Knowing how his mind worked, she
realized she'd been the subject of a mentat decision, uncounted bits falling
together in that human-computer analysis. There was an inexorable quality to
this realization -- a movement like the movement of planets. It carried
something of the order of the universe in it, inevitable and terrifying.
"Sire," Stilgar said, "perhaps we'd -- "
"Not now!" Paul snapped. "We've other problems at the moment."
Aware that she dared not try to match logic with her brother, Alia put the
past few moments aside, Bene Gesserit fashion, said: "Irulan sent you?" She
found herself experiencing menace in that thought.
"Indirectly," Paul said. "The information she gives us confirms our
suspicion that the Guild is about to try for a sandworm."
"They'll try to capture a small one and attempt to start the spice cycle on
some other world," Stilgar said. "It means they've found a world they consider
suitable."
"It means they have Fremen accomplices!" Alia argued. "No offworlder could
capture a worm!"
"That goes without saying," Stilgar said.
"No, it doesn't," Alia said. She was outraged by such obtuseness. "Paul,
certainly you . . ."
"The rot is setting in," Paul said. "We've known that for quite some time.
"I've never seen this other world, though, and that bothers me. If they -- "
"That bothers you?" Alia demanded. "It means only that they've clouded its
location with Steersmen the way they hide their sanctuaries."
Stilgar opened his mouth, closed it without speaking. He had the
overwhelming sensation that his idols had admitted blasphemous weakness.
Paul, sensing Stilgar's disquiet, said: "We've an immediate problem! I want
your opinion, Alia. Stilgar suggests we expand our patrols in the open bled and
reinforce the sietch watch. It's just possible we could spot a landing party and
prevent the -- "
"With a Steersman guiding them?" Alia asked.
"They are desperate, aren't they?" Paul agreed. "That is why I'm here."
"What've they seen that we haven't?" Alia asked.
"Precisely."
Alia nodded, remembering her thoughts about the new Dune Tarot. Quickly, she
recounted her fears.
"Throwing a blanket over us," Paul said.
"With adequate patrols," Stilgar ventured, "we might prevent the -- "
"We prevent nothing . . . forever," Alia said. She didn't like the feel of
the way Stilgar's mind was working now. He had narrowed his scope, eliminated
obvious essentials. This was not the Stilgar she remembered.
"We must count on their getting a worm," Paul said. "Whether they can start
the melange cycle on another planet is a different question. They'll need more
than a worm."
Stilgar looked from brother to sister. Out of ecological thinking that had
been ground into him by sietch life, he grasped their meaning. A captive worm
couldn't live except within a bit of Arrakis -- sand plankton, Little Makers and
all. The Guild's problem was large, but not impossible. His own growing
uncertainty lay in a different area.
"Then your visions do not detect the Guild at its work?" he asked.
"Damnation!" Paul exploded.
Alia studied Stilgar, sensing the savage sideshow of ideas taking place in
his mind. He was hung on a rack of enchantment. Magic! Magic! To glimpse the
future was to steal terrifying fire from a sacred flame. It held the attraction
of ultimate peril, souls ventured and lost. One brought back from the formless,
dangerous distances something with form and power. But Stilgar was beginning to
sense other forces, perhaps greater powers beyond that unknown horizon. His
Queen Witch and Sorcerer Friend betrayed dangerous weaknesses.
"Stilgar," Alia said, fighting to hold him, "you stand in a valley between
dunes. I stand on the crest. I see where you do not see. And, among other
things, I see mountains which conceal the distances."
"There are things hidden from you," Stilgar said. "This you've always said."
"All power is limited," Alia said.

"And danger may come from behind the mountains," Stilgar said.
"It's something on that order," Alia said.
Stilgar nodded, his gaze fastened on Paul's face. "But whatever comes from
behind the mountains must cross the dunes."

The most dangerous game in the universe is to govern from an oracular base. We
do not consider ourselves wise enough or brave enough to play that game. The
measures detailed here for regulation in lesser matters are as near as we dare
venture to the brink of government. For our purposes, we borrow a definition
from the Bene Gesserit and we consider the various worlds as gene pools, sources

to tap these gene pools, to learn, and to free ourselves from all restraints
imposed by dependency and government.
-"The Orgy as a Tool of Statecraft," Chapter Three of The Steersman's Guild
"Is that where your father died?" Edric asked, sending a beam pointer from
his tank to a jeweled marker on one of the relief maps adorning a wall of Paul's
reception salon.
"That's the shrine of his skull," Paul said. "My father died a prisoner on a
Harkonnen frigate in the sink below us."
"Oh, yes: I recall the story now," Edric said. "Something about killing the
old Baron Harkonnen, his mortal enemy." Hoping he didn't betray too much of the
terror which small enclosures such as this room imposed upon him, Edric rolled
over in the orange gas, directed his gaze at Paul, who sat alone on a long divan
of striped gray and black.
"My sister killed the Baron," Paul said, voice and manner dry, "just before
the battle of Arrakeen."
And why, he wondered, did the Guild man-fish reopen old wounds in this place
and at this time?
The Steersman appeared to be fighting a losing battle to contain his nervous
energies. Gone were the languid fish motions of their earlier encounter. Edric's
tiny eyes jerked here . . . there, questing and measuring. The one attendant who
had accompanied him in here stood apart near the line of houseguards ranging the
end wall at Paul's left. The attendant worried Paul -- hulking, thick-necked,
blunt and vacant face. The man had entered the salon, nudging Edric's tank along
on its supporting field, walking with a strangler's gait, arms akimbo.
Scytale, Edric had called him. Scytale, an aide.
The aide's surface shouted stupidity, but the eyes betrayed him. They
laughed at everything they saw.
"Your concubine appeared to enjoy the performance of the Face Dancers,"
Edric said. "It pleases me that I could provide that small entertainment. I
particularly enjoyed her reaction to seeing her own features simultaneously
repeated by the whole troupe."
"Isn't there a warning against Guildsmen bearing gifts?" Paul asked.
And he thought of the performance out there in the Great Hall. The dancers
had entered in the costumes and guise of the Dune Tarot, flinging themselves
about in seemingly random patterns that devolved into fire eddies and ancient
prognostic designs. Then had come the rulers -- a parade of kings and emperors
like faces on coins, formal and stiff in outline, but curiously fluid. And the
jokes: a copy of Paul's own face and body, Chani repeated across the floor of
the Hall, even Stilgar, who had grunted and shuddered while others laughed.
"But our gifts have the kindest intent," Edric protested.
"How kindly can you be?" Paul asked. "The ghola you gave us believes he was
designed to destroy us."
"Destroy you, Sire?" Edric asked, all bland attention. "Can one destroy a
god?"
Stilgar, entering on the last words, stopped, glared at the guards. They
were much farther from Paul than he liked. Angrily he motioned them closer.
"It's all right, Stil," Paul said, lifting a hand. "Just a friendly
discussion. Why don't you move the Ambassador's tank over by the end of my
divan?"
Stilgar, weighing the order, saw that it would put the Steersman's tank
between Paul and the hulking aide, much too close to Paul, but . . .
"It's all right, Stil," Paul repeated, and he gave the private hand-signal
which made the order an imperative.
Moving with obvious reluctance, Stilgar pushed the tank closer to Paul. He
didn't like the feel of the container or the heavily perfumed smell of melange
around it. He took up a position at the corner of the tank beneath the orbiting
device through which the Steersman spoke.
"To kill a god," Paul said. "That's very interesting. But who says I'm a
god?"
"Those who worship you," Edric said, glancing pointedly at Stilgar.
"Is this what you believe?" Paul asked.
"What I believe is of no moment, Sire," Edric said. "It seems to most
observers, however, that you conspire to make a god of yourself. And one might
ask if that is something any mortal can do . . . safely?"
Paul studied the Guildsman. Repellent creature, but perceptive. It was a
question Paul had asked himself time and again. But he had seen enough alternate
Timelines to know of worse possibilities than accepting godhead for himself.
Much worse. These were not, however, the normal avenues for a Steersman to
probe. Curious. Why had that question been asked? What could Edric hope to gain
by such effrontery? Paul's thoughts went flick (the association of Tleilaxu
would be behind this move) -- flick (the Jihad's recent Sembou victory would
bear on Edric's action) -- flick (various Bene Gesserit credos showed themselves
here) flick . . .
A process involving thousands of information bits poured flickering through
his computational awareness. It required perhaps three seconds.
"Does a Steersman question the guidelines of prescience?" Paul asked,
putting Edric on the weakest ground.
This disturbed the Steersman, but he covered well, coming up with what
sounded like a long aphorism: "No man of intelligence questions the fact of
prescience, Sire. Oracular vision has been known to men since most ancient
times. It has a way of entangling us when we least suspect. Luckily, there are
other forces in our universe."
"Greater than prescience?" Paul asked, pressing him.
"If prescience alone existed and did everything, Sire, it would annihilate
itself. Nothing but prescience? Where could it be applied except to its own
degenerating movements?"
"There's always the human situation," Paul agreed.
"A precarious thing at best," Edric said, "without confusing it by
hallucinations."
"Are my visions no more than hallucinations?" Paul asked, mock sadness in
his voice. "Or do you imply that my worshippers hallucinate?"
Stilgar, sensing the mounting tensions, moved a step nearer Paul, fixed his
attention on the Guildsman reclining in the tank.
"You twist my words, Sire," Edric protested. An odd sense of violence lay
suspended in the words.
Violence here? Paul wondered. They wouldn't dare! Unless (and he glanced at
his guards) the forces which protected him were to be used in replacing him.
"But you accuse me of conspiring to make a god of myself," Paul said,
pitching his voice that only Edric and Stilgar might hear. "Conspire?"
"A poor choice of words, perhaps, my Lord," Edric said.
"But significant," Paul said. "It says you expect the worst of me."
Edric arched his neck, stared sideways at Stilgar with a look of
apprehension. "People always expect the worst of the rich and powerful, Sire. It
is said one can always tell an aristocrat: he reveals only those of his vices
which will make him popular."
A tremor passed across Stilgar's face.
Paul looked up at the movement, sensing the thoughts and angers whispering
in Stilgar's mind. How dared this Guildsman talk thus to Muad'dib?
"You're not joking, of course," Paul said.
"Joking, Sire?"
Paul grew aware of dryness in his mouth. He felt that there were too many
people in this room, that the air he breathed had passed through too many lungs.
The taint of melange from Edric's tank felt threatening.
"Who might my accomplices be in such a conspiracy?" Paul asked presently.
"Do you nominate the Qizarate?"
Edric's shrug stirred the orange gas around his head. He no longer appeared
concerned by Stilgar, although the Fremen continued to glare at him.
"Are you suggesting that my missionaries of the Holy Orders, all of them,
are preaching subtle falsehood?" Paul insisted.
"It could be a question of self-interest and sincerity," Edric said.
Stilgar put a hand to the crysknife beneath his robe.
Paul shook his head, said: "Then you accuse me of insincerity."
"I'm not sure that accuse is the proper word, Sire."
The boldness of this creature! Paul thought. And he said: "Accused or not,
you're saying my bishops and I are no better than power-hungry brigands."
"Power-hungry, Sire?" Again, Edric looked at Stilgar. "Power tends to
isolate those who hold too much of it. Eventually, they lose touch with reality
. . . and fall."
"M'Lord," Stilgar growled, "you've had men executed for less!"
"Men, yes," Paul agreed. "But this is a Guild Ambassador."
"He accuses you of an unholy fraud!" Stilgar said.
"His thinking interests me, Stil," Paul said. "Contain your anger and remain
alert."
"As Muad'dib commands."
"Tell me, Steersman," Paul said, "how could we maintain this hypothetical
fraud over such enormous distances of space and time without the means to watch
every missionary, to examine every nuance in every Qizarate priory and temple?"
"What is time to you?" Edric asked.
Stilgar frowned in obvious puzzlement. And he thought: Muad'dib has often
said he sees past the veils of time. What is the Guildsman really saying?
"Wouldn't the structure of such a fraud begin to show holes?" Paul asked.
"Significant disagreements, schisms . . . doubts, confessions of guilt -- surely
fraud could not suppress all these."
"What religion and self-interest cannot hide, governments can," Edric said.
"Are you testing the limits of my tolerance?" Paul asked.
"Do my arguments lack all merit?" Edric countered.
Does he want us to kill him? Paul wondered. Is Edric offering himself as a
sacrifice?
"I prefer the cynical view," Paul said, testing. "You obviously are trained
in all the lying tricks of statecraft, the double meanings and the power words.
Language is nothing more than a weapon to you and, thus, you test my armor."
"The cynical view," Edric said, a smile stretching his mouth. "And rulers
are notoriously cynical where religions are concerned. Religion, too, is a
weapon. What manner of weapon is religion when it becomes the government?"
Paul felt himself go inwardly still, a profound caution gripping him. To
whom was Edric speaking? Damnable clever words, heavy with manipulation
leverages -- that undertone of comfortable humor, the unspoken air of shared
Secrets: his manner said he and Paul were two sophisticates, men of a wider
universe who understood things not granted common folk. With a feeling of shock,
Paul realized that he had not been the main target for all this rhetoric. This
affliction visited upon the court had been speaking for the benefit of others -speaking to Stilgar, to the household guards . . . perhaps even to the hulking
aide.
"Religious mana was thrust upon me," Paul said. "I did not seek it." And he
thought: There! Let this man-fish think himself victorious in our battle of
words!
"Then why have you not disavowed it, Sire?" Edric asked.
"Because of my sister Alia," Paul said, watching Edric carefully. "She is a
goddess. Let me urge caution where Alia is concerned lest she strike you dead
with her glance."
A gloating smile began forming on Edric's mouth, was replaced by a look of
shock.
"I am deadly serious," Paul said, watching the shock spread, seeing Stilgar
nod.
In a bleak voice, Edric said: "You have mauled my confidence in you, Sire.
And no doubt that was your intent."
"Do not be certain you know my intent," Paul said, and he signaled Stilgar
that the audience was at an end.
To Stilgar's questioning gesture asking if Edric were to be assassinated,
Paul gave a negative hand-sign, amplified it with an imperative lest Stilgar
take matters into his own hands.
Scytale, Edric's aide, moved to the rear corner of the tank, nudged it
toward the door. When he came opposite Paul, he stopped, turned that laughing
gaze on Paul, said: "If my Lord permits?"
"Yes, what is it?" Paul asked, noting how Stilgar moved close in answer to
the implied menace from this man.
"Some say," Scytale said, "that people cling to Imperial leadership because
space is infinite. They feel lonely without a unifying symbol. For a lonely
people, the Emperor is a definite place. They can turn toward him and say: 'See,
there He is. He makes us one.' Perhaps religion serves the same purpose,
m'Lord."
Scytale nodded pleasantly, gave Edric's tank another nudge. They moved out
of the salon, Edric supine in his tank, eyes closed. The Steersman appeared
spent, all his nervous energies exhausted.
Paul stared after the shambling figure of Scytale, wondering at the man's
words. A peculiar fellow, that Scytale, he thought. While he was speaking, he
had radiated a feeling of many people -- as though his entire genetic
inheritance lay exposed on his skin.
"That was odd," Stilgar said, speaking to no one in particular.
Paul arose from the divan as a guard closed the door behind Edric and the
escort.
"Odd," Stilgar repeated. A vein throbbed at his temple.
Paul dimmed the salon's lights, moved to a window which opened onto an
angled cliff of his Keep. Lights glittered far below -- pigmy movement. A work
gang moved down there bringing giant plasmeld blocks to repair a facade of
Alia's temple which had been damaged by a freak twisting of a sandblast wind.
"That was a foolish thing, Usul, inviting that creature into these
chambers," Stilgar said.
Usul, Paul thought. My sietch name. Stilgar reminds me that he ruled over me
once, that he saved me from the desert.
"Why did you do it?" Stilgar asked, speaking from close behind Paul.
"Data," Paul said. "I need more data."
"Is it not dangerous to try meeting this threat only as a mentat?"
That was perceptive, Paul thought.
Mentat computation remained finite. You couldn't say something boundless
within the boundaries of any language. Mentat abilities had their uses, though.
He said as much now, daring Stilgar to refute his argument.
"There's always something outside," Stilgar said. "Some things best kept
outside."
"Or inside," Paul said. And he accepted for a moment his own oracular/mentat
summation. Outside, yes. And inside: here lay the true horror. How could he
protect himself from himself? They certainly were setting him up to destroy
himself, but this was a position hemmed in by even more terrifying
possibilities.
His reverie was broken by the sound of rapid footsteps. The figure of Korba
the Qizara surged through the doorway backlighted by the brilliant illumination
in the hallways. He entered as though hurled by an unseen force and came to an
almost immediate halt when he encountered the salon's gloom. His hands appeared
to be full of shigawire reels. They glittered in the light from the hall,
strange little round jewels that were extinguished as a guardsman's hand came
into view, closed the door.
"Is that you, m'Lord?" Korba asked, peering into the shadows.
"What is it?" Stilgar asked.
"Stilgar?"
"We're both here. What is it?"
"I'm disturbed by this reception for the Guildsman."
"Disturbed?" Paul asked.
"The people say, m'Lord, that you honor our enemies."
"Is that all?" Paul said. "Are those the reels I asked you to bring
earlier?" He indicated the shigawire orbs in Korba's hands.
"Reels . . . oh! Yes, m'Lord. These are the histories. Will you view them
here?"
"I've viewed them. I want them for Stilgar here."
"For me?" Stilgar asked. He felt resentment grow at what he interpreted as
caprice on Paul's part. Histories! Stilgar had sought out Paul earlier to
discuss the logistics computations for the Zabulon conquest. The Guild
Ambassador's presence had intervened. And now -- Korba with histories!
"How much history do you know?" Paul mused aloud, studying the shadowy
figure beside him.
"M'Lord, I can name every world our people touched in their migrations. I
know the reaches of Imperial . . ."
"The Golden Age of Earth, have you ever studied that?"
"Earth? Golden Age?" Stilgar was irritated and puzzled. Why would Paul wish
to discuss myths from the dawn of time? Stilgar's mind still felt crammed with
Zabulon data -- computations from the staff mentats: two hundred and five attack
frigates with thirty legions, support battalions, pacification cadres, Qizarate
missionaries . . . the food requirements (he had the figures right here in his
mind) and melange . . . weaponry, uniforms, medals . . . urns for the ashes of
the dead . . . the number of specialists -- men to produce raw materials of
propaganda, clerks, accountants . . . spies . . . and spies upon the spies . . .
"I brought the pulse-synchronizer attachment, also, m'Lord," Korba ventured.
He obviously sensed the tensions building between Paul and Stilgar and was
disturbed by them.
Stilgar shook his head from side to side. Pulse-synchronizer? Why would Paul
wish him to use a mnemonic flutter-system on a shigawire projector? Why scan for
specific data in histories? This was mentat work! As usual, Stilgar found he
couldn't escape a deep suspicion at the thought of using a projector and
attachments. The thing always immersed him in disturbing sensations, an
overwhelming shower of data which his mind sorted out later, surprising him with
information he had not known he possessed.

"Sire, I came with the Zabulon computations," Stilgar said.
"Dehydrate the Zabulon computations!" Paul snapped, using the obscene Fremen
term which meant that here was moisture no man could demean himself by touching.
"M'Lord!"
"Stilgar," Paul said, "you urgently need a sense of balance which can come
only from an understanding of long-term effects. What little information we have
about the old times, the pittance of data which the Butlerians left us, Korba
has brought it for you. Start with the Genghis Khan."
"Ghengis . . . Khan? Was he of the Sardaukar, m'Lord?"
"Oh, long before that. He killed . . . perhaps four million."
"He must've had formidable weaponry to kill that many, Sire. Lasbeams,
perhaps, or . . ."
"He didn't kill them himself, Stil. He killed the way I kill, by sending out
his legions. There's another emperor I want you to note in passing -- a Hitler.
He killed more than six million. Pretty good for those days."
"Killed . . . by his legions?" Stilgar asked.
"Yes."
"Not very impressive statistics, m'Lord."
"Very good, Stil." Paul glanced at the reels in Korba's hands. Korba stood
with them as though he wished he could drop them and flee. "Statistics: at a
conservative estimate, I've killed sixty-one billion, sterilized ninety planets,
completely demoralized five hundred others. I've wiped out the followers of
forty religions which had existed since -- "
"Unbelievers!" Korba protested. "Unbelievers all!"
"No," Paul said. "Believers."
"My Liege makes a joke," Korba said, voice trembling. "The Jihad has brought
ten thousand worlds into the shining light of -- "
"Into the darkness," Paul said. "We'll be a hundred generations recovering
from Muad'dib's Jihad. I find it hard to imagine that anyone will ever surpass
this." A barking laugh erupted from his throat.
"What amuses Muad'dib?" Stilgar asked.
"I am not amused. I merely had a sudden vision of the Emperor Hitler saying
something similar. No doubt he did."
"No other ruler ever had your powers," Korba argued. "Who would dare
challenge you? Your legions control the known universe and all the -- "
"The legions control," Paul said. "I wonder if they know this?"
"You control your legions, Sire," Stilgar interrupted, and it was obvious
from the tone of his voice that he suddenly felt his own position in that chain
of command, his own hand guiding all that power.
Having set Stilgar's thoughts in motion along the track he wanted, Paul
turned his full attention to Korba, said: "Put the reels here on the divan." As
Korba obeyed, Paul said: "How goes the reception, Korba? Does my sister have
everything well in hand?"
"Yes, m'Lord." Korba's tone was wary. "And Chani watches from the spy hole.
She suspects there may be Sardaukar in the Guild entourage."
"No doubt she's correct," Paul said. "The jackals gather."
"Bannerjee," Stilgar said, naming the chief of Paul's Security detail, "was
worried earlier that some of them might try to penetrate the private areas of
the Keep."
"Have they?"
"Not yet."
"But there was some confusion in the formal gardens," Korba said.
"What sort of confusion?" Stilgar demanded.
Paul nodded.
"Strangers coming and going," Korba said, "trampling the plants, whispered
conversations -- I heard reports of some disturbing remarks."
"Such as?" Paul asked.

"Is this the way our taxes are spent? I'm told the Ambassador himself asked
that question."
"I don't find that surprising," Paul said. "Were there many strangers in the
gardens?"
"Dozens, m'Lord."
"Bannerjee stationed picked troopers at the vulnerable doors, m'Lord,"
Stilgar said. He turned as he spoke, allowing the salon's single remaining light
to illuminate half his face. The peculiar lighting, the face, all touched a node
of memory in Paul's mind -- something from the desert. Paul didn't bother
bringing it to full recall, his attention being focused on how Stilgar had
pulled back mentally. The Fremen had a tight-skinned forehead which mirrored
almost every thought flickering across his mind. He was suspicious now,
profoundly suspicious of his Emperor's odd behavior.
"I don't like the intrusion into the gardens," Paul said. "Courtesy to
guests is one thing, and the formal necessities of greeting an envoy, but this .
. . "
"I'll see to removing them," Korba said. "Immediately."
"Wait!" Paul ordered as Korba started to turn.
In the abrupt stillness of the moment, Stilgar edged himself into a position
where he could study Paul's face. It was deftly done. Paul admired the way of
it, an achievement devoid of any forwardness. It was a Fremen thing: slyness
touched by respect for another's privacy, a movement of necessity.
"What time is it?" Paul asked.
"Almost midnight, Sire," Korba said.
"Korba, I think you may be my finest creation," Paul said.
"Sire!" There was injury in Korba's voice.
"Do you feel awe of me?" Paul asked.
"You are Paul-Muad'dib who was Usul in our sietch," Korba said. "You know my
devotion to -- "
"Have you ever felt like an apostle?" Paul asked.
Korba obviously misunderstood the words, but correctly interpreted the tone.
"My Emperor knows I have a clean conscience!"
"Shai-hulud save us," Paul murmured.
The questioning silence of the moment was broken by the sound of someone
whistling as he walked down the outer hall. The whistling was stilled by a
guardsman's barked command as it came opposite the door.
"Korba, I think you may survive all this," Paul said. And he read the
growing light of understanding on Stilgar's face.
"The strangers in the gardens, Sire?" Stilgar asked.
"Ahh, yes," Paul said. "Have Bannerjee put them out, Stil. Korba will
assist."
"Me, Sire?" Korba betrayed deep disquiet.
"Some of my friends have forgotten they once were Fremen," Paul said,
speaking to Korba, but designing his words for Stilgar. "You will mark down the
ones Chani identifies as Sardaukar and you will have them killed. Do it
yourself. I want it done quietly and without undue disturbance. We must keep in
mind that there's more to religion and government than approving treaties and
sermons."
"I obey the orders of Muad'dib," Korba whispered.
"The Zabulon computations?" Stilgar asked.
"Tomorrow," Paul said. "And when the strangers are removed from the gardens,
announce that the reception is ended. The party's over, Stil."
"I understand, m'Lord."
"I'm sure you do," Paul said.

A narrow and a tall one.
-Tleilaxu Epigram
Alia crouched, resting elbows on knees, chin on fists, stared at the body on
the dune -- a few bones and some tattered flesh that once had been a young
woman. The hands, the head, most of the upper torso were gone -- eaten by the
coriolis wind. The sand all around bore the tracks of her brother's medics and
questors. They were gone now, all excepting the mortuary attendants who stood to
one side with Hayt, the ghola, waiting for her to finish her mysterious perusal
of what had been written here.
A wheat-colored sky enfolded the scene in the glaucous light common to
midafternoon for these latitudes.
The body had been discovered several hours earlier by a low-flying courier
whose instruments had detected a faint water trace where none should be. His
call had brought the experts. And they had learned -- what? That this had been a
woman of about twenty years, Fremen, addicted to semuta . . . and she had died
here in the crucible of the desert from the effects of a subtle poison of
Tleilaxu origin.
To die in the desert was a common enough occurrence. But a Fremen addicted
to semuta, this was such a rarity that Paul had sent her to examine the scene in
the ways their mother had taught them.
Alia felt that she had accomplished nothing here except to cast her own aura
of mystery about a scene that was already mysterious enough. She heard the
ghola's feet stir the sand, looked at him. His attention rested momentarily upon
the escort 'thopters circling overhead like a flock of ravens.
Beware of the Guild bearing gifts, Alia thought.
The mortuary 'thopter and her own craft stood on the sand near a rock
outcropping behind the ghola. Focusing on the grounded 'thopters filled Alia
with a craving to be airborne and away from here.
But Paul had thought she might see something here which others would miss.
She squirmed in her stillsuit. It felt raspingly unfamiliar after all the
suitless months of city life. She studied the ghola, wondering if he might know
something important about this peculiar death. A lock of his black-goat hair,
she saw, had escaped his stillsuit hood. She sensed her hand longing to tuck
that hair back into place.
As though lured by this thought, his gleaming gray metal eyes turned toward
her. The eyes set her trembling and she tore her gaze away from him.
A Fremen woman had died here from a poison called "the throat of hell."
A Fremen addicted to semuta.
She shared Paul's disquiet at this conjunction.
The mortuary attendants waited patiently. This corpse contained not enough
water for them to salvage. They felt no need to hurry. And they'd believe that
Alia, through some glyptic art, was reading a strange truth in these remains.
No strange truth came to her.
There was only a distant feeling of anger deep within her at the obvious
thoughts in the attendants' minds. It was a product of the damned religious
mystery. She and her brother could not be people. They had to be something more.
The Bene Gesserit had seen to that by manipulating Atreides ancestry. Their
mother had contributed to it by thrusting them onto the path of witchery.
And Paul perpetuated the difference.
The Reverend Mothers encapsulated in Alia's memories stirred restlessly,
provoking adab flashes of thought: "Peace, Little One! You are what you are.
There are compensations."
Compensations!

She summoned the ghola with a gesture.
He stopped beside her, attentive, patient.
"What do you see in this?" she asked.
"We may never learn who it was died here," he said. "The head, the teeth are
gone. The hands . . . Unlikely such a one had a genetic record somewhere to
which her cells could be matched."
"Tleilaxu poison," she said. "What do you make of that?"
"Many people buy such poisons."
"True enough. And this flesh is too far gone to be regrown as was done with
your body."
"Even if you could trust the Tleilaxu to do it," he said.
She nodded, stood. "You will fly me back to the city now."
When they were airborne and pointed north, she said: "You fly exactly as
Duncan Idaho did."
He cast a speculative glance at her. "Others have told me this."
"What are you thinking now?" she asked.
"Many things."
"Stop dodging my question, damn you!"
"Which question?"
She glared at him.
He saw the glare, shrugged.
How like Duncan Idaho, that gesture, she thought. Accusingly, her voice
thick and with a catch in it, she said: "I merely wanted your reactions voiced
to play my own thoughts against them. That young woman's death bothers me."
"I was not thinking about that."
"What were you thinking about?"
"About the strange emotions I feel when people speak of the one I may have
been."
"May have been?"
"The Tleilaxu are very clever."
"Not that clever. You were Duncan Idaho."
"Very likely. It's the prime computation."
"So you get emotional?"
"To a degree. I feel eagerness. I'm uneasy. There's a tendency to tremble
and I must devote effort to controlling it. I get . . . flashes of imagery."
"What imagery?"
"It's too rapid to recognize. Flashes. Spasms . . . almost memories."
"Aren't you curious about such memories?"
"Of course. Curiosity urges me forward, but I move against a heavy
reluctance. I think: 'What if I'm not the one they believe me to be?' I don't
like that thought."
"And this is all you were thinking?"
"You know better than that, Alia."
How dare he use my given name? She felt anger rise and go down beneath the
memory of the way he'd spoken: softly throbbing undertones, casual male
confidence. A muscle twitched along her jaw. She clenched her teeth.
"Isn't that El Kuds down there?" he asked, dipping a wing briefly, causing a
sudden flurry in their escort.
She looked down at their shadows rippling across the promontory above Harg
Pass, at the cliff and the rock pyramid containing the skull of her father. El
Kuds -- the Holy Place.
"That's the Holy Place," she said.
"I must visit that place one day," he said. "Nearness to your father's
remains may bring memories I can capture."
She saw suddenly how strong must be this need to know who he'd been. It was
a central compulsion with him. She looked back at the rocks, the cliff with its
base sloping into a dry beach and a sea of sand -- cinnamon rock lifting from
the dunes like a ship breasting waves.
"Circle back," she said.
"The escort . . . "
"They'll follow. Swing under them."
He obeyed.
"Do you truly serve my brother?" she asked, when he was on the new course,
the escort following.
"I serve the Atreides," he said, his tone formal.
And she saw his right hand lift, fall -- almost the old salute of Caladan. A
pensive look came over his face. She watched him peer down at the rock pyramid.
"What bothers you?" she asked.
His lips moved. A voice emerged, brittle, tight: "He was . . . he was . . ."
A tear slid down his cheek.
Alia found herself stilled by Fremen awe. He gave water to the dead!
Compulsively, she touched a finger to his cheek, felt the tear.
"Duncan," she whispered.
He appeared locked to the 'thopter's controls, gaze fastened to the tomb
below.
She raised her voice: "Duncan!"
He swallowed, shook his head, looked at her, the metal eyes glistening. "I .
. . felt . . . an arm . . . on my shoulders," he whispered. "I felt it! An arm."
His throat worked. "It was . . . a friend. It was . . . my friend."
"Who?"
"I don't know. I think it was . . . I don't know."
The call light began flashing in front of Alia, their escort captain wanting
to know why they returned to the desert. She took the microphone, explained that
they had paid a brief homage to her father's tomb. The captain reminded her that
it was late.
"We will go to Arrakeen now," she said, replacing the microphone.
Hayt took a deep breath, banked their 'thopter around to the north.
"It was my father's arm you felt, wasn't it?" she asked.
"Perhaps."
His voice was that of the mentat computing probabilities, and she saw he had
regained his composure.
"Are you aware of how I know my father?" she asked.
"I have some idea."
"Let me make it clear," she said. Briefly, she explained how she had
awakened to Reverend Mother awareness before birth, a terrified fetus with the
knowledge of countless lives embedded in her nerve cells -- and all this after
the death of her father.
"I know my father as my mother knew him," she said. "In every last detail of
every experience she shared with him. In a way, I am my mother. I have all her
memories up to the moment when she drank the Water of Life and entered the
trance of transmigration."
"Your brother explained something of this."
"He did? Why?"
"I asked."
"Why?"
"A mentat requires data."
"Oh." She looked down at the flat expanse of the Shield Wall -- tortured
rock, pits and crevices.
He saw the direction of her gaze, said: "A very exposed place, that down
there."
"But an easy place to hide," she said. She looked at him. "It reminds me of
a human mind . . . with all its concealments."
"Ahhh," he said.

"Ahhh? What does that mean -- ahhh?" She was suddenly angry with him and the
reason for it escaped her.
"You'd like to know what my mind conceals," he said. It was a statement, not
a question.
"How do you know I haven't exposed you for what you are by my powers of
prescience?" she demanded.
"Have you?" He seemed genuinely curious.
"No!"
"Sibyls have limits," he said.
He appeared to be amused and this reduced Alia's anger. "Amused? Have you no
respect for my powers?" she asked. The question sounded weakly argumentative
even to her own ears.
"I respect your omens and portents perhaps more than you think," he said. "I
was in the audience for your Morning Ritual."
"And what does that signify?"
"You've great ability with symbols," he said, keeping his attention on the
'thopter's controls. "That's a Bene Gesserit thing, I'd say. But, as with many
witches, you've become careless of your powers."
She felt a spasm of fear, blared: "How dare you?"
"I dare much more than my makers anticipated," he said. "Because of that
rare fact, I remain with your brother."
Alia studied the steel balls which were his eyes: no human expression there.
The stillsuit hood concealed the line of his jaw. His mouth remained firm,
though. Great strength in it . . . and determination. His words had carried a
reassuring intensity. " . . . dare much more . . . " That was a thing Duncan
Idaho might have said. Had the Tleilaxu fashioned their ghola better than they
knew -- or was this mere sham, part of his conditioning?
"Explain yourself, ghola," she commanded.
"Know thyself, is that thy commandment?" he asked.
Again, she felt that he was amused. "Don't bandy words with me, you . . .
you thing!" she said. She put a hand to the crysknife in its throat sheath. "Why
were you given to my brother?"
"Your brother tells me that you watched the presentation," he said. "You've
heard me answer that question for him."
"Answer it again . . . for me!"
"I am intended to destroy him."
"Is that the mentat speaking?"
"You know the answer to that without asking," he chided. "And you know, as
well, that such a gift wasn't necessary. Your brother already was destroying
himself quite adequately."
She weighed these words, her hand remaining on the haft of her knife. A
tricky answer, but there was sincerity in the voice.
"Then why such a gift?" she probed.
"It may have amused the Tleilaxu. And, it is true, that the Guild asked for
me as a gift."
"Why?"
"Same answer."
"How am I careless of my powers?"
"How are you employing them?" he countered.
His question slashed through to her own misgivings. She took her hand away
from the knife, asked: "Why do you say my brother was destroying himself?"
"Oh, come now, child! Where are these vaunted powers? Have you no ability to
reason?"
Controlling anger, she said: "Reason for me, mentat."
"Very well." He glanced around at their escort, returned his attention to
their course. The plain of Arrakeen was beginning to show beyond the northern
rim of the Shield Wall. The pattern of the pan and graben villages remained
indistinct beneath a dust pall, but the distant gleam of Arrakeen could be
discerned.
"Symptoms," he said. "Your brother keeps an official Panegyrist who -- "
"Who was a gift of the Fremen Naibs!"
"An odd gift from friends," he said. "Why would they surround him with
flattery and servility? Have you really listened to this Panegyrist? 'The people
are illuminated by Muad'dib. The Umma Regent, our Emperor, came out of darkness
to shine resplendently upon all men. He is our Sire. He is precious water from
an endless fountain. He spills joy for all the universe to drink,' Pah!"
Speaking softly, Alia said: "If I but repeated your words for our Fremen
escort, they'd hack you into bird feed."
"Then tell them."
"My brother rules by the natural law of heaven!"
"You don't believe that, so why say it?"
"How do you know what I believe?" She experienced trembling that no Bene
Gesserit powers could control. This ghola was having an effect she hadn't
anticipated.
"You commanded me to reason as a mentat," he reminded her.
"No mentat knows what I believe!" She took two deep, shuddering breaths.
"How dare you judge us?"
"Judge you? I don't judge."
"You've no idea how we were taught!"
"Both of you were taught to govern," he said. "You were conditioned to an
overweening thirst for power. You were imbued with a shrewd grasp of politics
and a deep understanding for the uses of war and ritual. Natural law? What
natural law? That myth haunts human history. Haunts! It's a ghost. It's
insubstantial, unreal. Is your Jihad a natural law?"
"Mentat jabber," she sneered.
"I'm a servant of the Atreides and I speak with candor," he said.
"Servant? We've no servants; only disciples."
"And I am a disciple of awareness," he said. "Understand that, child, and
you -- "
"Don't call me child!" she snapped. She slipped her crysknife half out of
its sheath.
"I stand corrected." He glanced at her, smiled, returned his attention to
piloting the 'thopter. The cliffsided structure of the Atreides Keep could be
made out now, dominating the northern suburbs of Arrakeen. "You are something
ancient in flesh that is little more than a child," he said. "And the flesh is
disturbed by its new womanhood."
"I don't know why I listen to you," she growled, but she let the crysknife
fall back into its sheath, wiped her palm on her robe. The palm, wet with
perspiration, disturbed her sense of Fremen frugality. Such a waste of the
body's moisture!
"You listen because you know I'm devoted to your brother," he said. "My
actions are clear and easily understood."
"Nothing about you is clear and easily understood. You're the most complex
creature I've ever seen. How do I know what the Tleilaxu built into you?"
"By mistake or intent," he said, "they gave me freedom to mold myself."
"You retreat into Zensunni parables," she accused. "The wise man molds
himself -- the fool lives only to die." Her voice was heavy with mimicry.
"Disciple of awareness!"
"Men cannot separate means and enlightenment," he said.
"You speak riddles!"
"I speak to the opening mind."
"I'm going to repeat all this to Paul."
"He's heard most of it already."
She found herself overwhelmed by curiosity. "How is it you're still alive .
. . and free? What did he say?"
"He laughed. And he said, 'People don't want a bookkeeper for an Emperor;
they want a master, someone who'll protect them from change.' But he agreed that
destruction of his Empire arises from himself."
"Why would he say such things?"
"Because I convinced him I understand his problem and will help him."
"What could you possibly have said to do that?"
He remained silent, banking the 'thopter into the downwind leg for a landing
at the guard complex on the roof of the Keep.
"I demand you tell me what you said!"
"I'm not sure you could take it."
"I'll be the judge of that! I command you to speak at once!"
"Permit me to land us first," he said. And not waiting for her permission,
he turned onto the base leg, brought the wings into optimum lift, settled gently
onto the bright orange pad atop the roof.
"Now," Alia said. "Speak."
"I told him that to endure oneself may be the hardest task in the universe."
She shook her head. "That's . . . that's . . . "
"A bitter pill," he said, watching the guards run toward them across the
roof, taking up their escort positions.
"Bitter nonsense!"
"The greatest palatinate earl and the lowliest stipendiary serf share the
same problem. You cannot hire a mentat or any other intellect to solve it for
you. There's no writ of inquest or calling of witnesses to provide answers. No
servant -- or disciple -- can dress the wound. You dress it yourself or continue
bleeding for all to see."
She whirled away from him, realizing in the instant of action what this
betrayed about her own feelings. Without wile of voice or witch-wrought
trickery, he had reached into her psyche once more. How did he do this?
"What have you told him to do?" she whispered.
"I told him to judge, to impose order."
Alia stared out at the guard, marking how patiently they waited -- how
orderly. "To dispense justice," she murmured.
"Not that!" he snapped. "I suggested that he judge, no more, guided by one
principle, perhaps . . ."
"And that?"
"To keep his friends and destroy his enemies."
"To judge unjustly, then."
"What is justice? Two forces collide. Each may have the right in his own
sphere. And here's where an Emperor commands orderly solutions. Those collisions
he cannot prevent -- he solves."
"How?"
"In the simplest way: he decides."
"Keeping his friends and destroying his enemies."
"Isn't that stability? People want order, this kind or some other. They sit
in the prison of their hungers and see that war has become the sport of the
rich. That's a dangerous form of sophistication. It's disorderly."
"I will suggest to my brother that you are much too dangerous and must be
destroyed," she said, turning to face him.
"A solution I've already suggested," he said.
"And that's why you are dangerous," she said, measuring out her words.
"You've mastered your passions."
"That is not why I'm dangerous." Before she could move, he leaned across,
gripped her chin in one hand, planted his lips on hers.

It was a gentle kiss, brief. He pulled away and she stared at him with a
shock leavened by glimpses of spasmodic grins on the faces of her guardsmen
still standing at orderly attention outside.
Alia put a finger to her lips. There'd been such a sense of familiarity
about that kiss. His lips had been flesh of a future she'd seen in some
prescient byway. Breast heaving, she said: "I should have you flayed."
"Because I'm dangerous?"
"Because you presume too much!"
"I presume nothing. I take nothing which is not first offered to me. Be glad
I did not take all that was offered." He opened his door, slid out. "Come along.
We've dallied too long on a fool's errand." He strode toward the entrance dome
beyond the pad.
Alia leaped out, ran to match his stride. "I'll tell him everything you've
said and everything you did," she said.
"Good." He held the door for her.
"He will order you executed," she said, slipping into the dome.
"Why? Because I took the kiss I wanted?" He followed her, his movement
forcing her back. The door slid closed behind him.
"The kiss you wanted!" Outrage filled her.
"All right, Alia. The kiss you wanted, then." He started to move around her
toward the drop field.
As though his movement had propelled her into heightened awareness, she
realized his candor -- the utter truthfulness of him. The kiss I wanted, she
told herself. True.
"Your truthfulness, that's what's dangerous," she said, following him.
"You return to the ways of wisdom," he said, not breaking his stride. "A
mentat could not've stated the matter more directly. Now: what is it you saw in
the desert?"
She grabbed his arm, forcing him to a halt. He'd done it again: shocked her
mind into sharpened awareness.
"I can't explain it," she said, "but I keep thinking of the Face Dancers.
Why is that?"
"That is why your brother sent you to the desert," he said, nodding. "Tell
him of this persistent thought."
"But why?" She shook her head. "Why Face Dancers?"
"There's a young woman dead out there," he said. "Perhaps no young woman is
reported missing among the Fremen."

I think what a joy it is to be alive, and I wonder if I'll ever leap inward to
the root of this flesh and know myself as once I was. The root is there. Whether
any act of mine can find it, that remains tangled in the future. But all things
a man can do are mine. Any act of mine may do it.
-The Ghola Speaks Alia's Commentary
As he lay immersed in the screaming odor of the spice, staring inward
through the oracular trance, Paul saw the moon become an elongated sphere. It
rolled and twisted, hissing -- the terrible hissing of a star being quenched in
an infinite sea -- down . . . down . . . down . . . like a ball thrown by a
child.
It was gone.
This moon had not set. Realization engulfed him. It was gone: no moon. The
earth quaked like an animal shaking its skin. Terror swept over him.
Paul jerked upright on his pallet, eyes wide open, staring. Part of him
looked outward, part inward. Outwardly, he saw the plasmeld grillwork which
vented his private room, and he knew he lay beside a stone-like abyss of his
Keep. Inwardly, he continued to see the moon fall.
Out! Out!
His grillwork of plasmeld looked onto the blazing light of noon across
Arrakeen. Inward -- there lay blackest night. A shower of sweet odors from a
garden roof nibbled at his senses, but no floral perfume could roll back that
fallen moon.
Paul swung his feet to the cold surface of the floor, peered through the
grillwork. He could see directly across to the gentle arc of a footbridge
constructed of crystal-stabilized gold and platinum. Fire jewels from far Cedon
decorated the bridge. It led to the galleries of the inner city across a pool
and fountain filled with waterflowers. If he stood, Paul knew, he could look
down into petals as clean and red as fresh blood whirling, turning there -disks of ambient color tossed on an emerald freshet.
His eyes absorbed the scene without pulling him from spice thralldom.
That terrible vision of a lost moon.
The vision suggested a monstrous loss of individual security. Perhaps he'd
seen his civilization fall, toppled by its own pretensions.
A moon . . . a moon . . . a falling moon.
It had taken a massive dose of the spice essence to penetrate the mud thrown
up by the tarot. All it had shown him was a falling moon and the hateful way
he'd known from the beginning. To buy an end for the Jihad, to silence the
volcano of butchery, he must discredit himself.
Disengage . . . disengage . . . disengage . . .
Floral perfume from the garden roof reminded him of Chani. He longed for her
arms now, for the clinging arms of love and forgetfulness. But even Chani could
not exorcise this vision. What would Chani say if he went to her with the
statement that he had a particular death in mind? Knowing it to be inevitable,
why not choose an aristocrat's death, ending life on a secret flourish,
squandering any years that might have been? To die before coming to the end of
willpower, was that not an aristocrat's choice?
He stood, crossed to the lapped opening in the grillwork, went out onto a
balcony which looked upward to flowers and vines trailing from the garden. His
mouth held the dryness of a desert march.
Moon . . . moon -- where is that moon?
He thought of Alia's description, the young woman's body found in the dunes.
A Fremen addicted to semuta! Everything fitted the hateful pattern.
You do not take from this universe, he thought. It grants what it will.
The remains of a conch shell from the seas of Mother Earth lay on a low
table beside the balcony rail. He took its lustrous smoothness into his hands,
tried to feel backward in Time. The pearl surface reflected glittering moons of
light. He tore his gaze from it, peered upward past the garden to a sky become a
conflagration -- trails of rainbow dust shining in the silver sun.
My Fremen call themselves "Children of the Moon," he thought.
He put down the conch, strode along the balcony. Did that terrifying moon
hold out hope of escape? He probed for meaning in the region of mystic
communion. He felt weak, shaken, still gripped by the spice.
At the north end of his plasmeld chasm, he came in sight of the lower
buildings of the government warren. Foot traffic thronged the roof walks. He
felt that the people moved there like a frieze against a background of doors,
walls, tile designs. The people were tiles! When he blinked, he could hold them
frozen in his mind. A frieze.
A moon falls and is gone.
A feeling came over him that the city out there had been translated into an
odd symbol for his universe. The buildings he could see had been erected on the
plain where his Fremen had obliterated the Sardaukar legions. Ground once
trampled by battles rang now to the rushing clamor of business.

Keeping to the balcony's outer edge, Paul strode around the corner. Now, his
vista was a suburb where city structures lost themselves in rocks and the
blowing sand of the desert. Alia's temple dominated the foreground; green and
black hangings along its two-thousand-meter sides displayed the moon symbol of
Muad'dib.
A falling moon.
Paul passed a hand across his forehead and eyes. The symbol-metropolis
oppressed him. He despised his own thoughts. Such vacillation in another would
have aroused his anger.
He loathed his city!
Rage rooted in boredom flickered and simmered deep within him, nurtured by
decisions that couldn't be avoided. He knew which path his feet must follow.
He'd seen it enough times, hadn't he? Seen it! Once . . . long ago, he'd thought
of himself as an inventor of government. But the invention had fallen into old
patterns. It was like some hideous contrivance with plastic memory. Shape it any
way you wanted, but relax for a moment, and it snapped into the ancient forms.
Forces at work beyond his reach in human breasts eluded and defied him.
Paul stared out across the rooftops. What treasures of untrammeled life lay
beneath those roofs? He glimpsed leaf-green places, open plantings amidst the
chalk-red and gold of the roofs. Green, the gift of Muad'dib and his water.
Orchards and groves lay within his view -- open plantings to rival those of
fabled Lebanon.
"Muad'dib spends water like a madman," Fremen said.
Paul put his hands over his eyes.
The moon fell.
He dropped his hands, stared at his metropolis with clarified vision.
Buildings took on an aura of monstrous imperial barbarity. They stood enormous
and bright beneath the northern sun. Colossi! Every extravagance of architecture
a demented history could produce lay within his view: terraces of mesa
proportion, squares as large as some cities, parks, premises, bits of cultured
wilderness.
Superb artistry abutted inexplicable prodigies of dismal tastelessness.
Details impressed themselves upon him: a postern out of most ancient Baghdad . .
. a dome dreamed in mythical Damascus . . . an arch from the low gravity of Atar
. . . harmonious elevations and queer depths. All created an effect of unrivaled
magnificence.
A moon! A moon! A moon!
Frustration tangled him. He felt the pressure of mass-unconscious, that
burgeoning sweep of humankind across his universe. They rushed upon him with a
force like a gigantic tidal bore. He sensed the vast migrations at work in human
affairs: eddies, currents, gene flows. No dams of abstinence, no seizures of
impotence nor maledictions could stop it.
Muad'dib's Jihad was less than an eye-blink in this larger movement. The
Bene Gesserit swimming in this tide, that corporate entity trading in genes, was
trapped in the torrent as he was. Visions of a falling moon must be measured
against other legends, other visions in a universe where even the seemingly
eternal stars waned, flickered, died . . .
What mattered a single moon in such a universe?
Far within his fortress citadel, so deep within that the sound sometimes
lost itself in the flow of city noises, a ten-string rebaba tinkled with a song
of the Jihad, a lament for a woman left behind on Arrakis:
Her hips are dunes curved by the wind,
Her eyes shine like summer heat.
Two braids of hair hang down her back -Rich with water rings, her hair!
My hands remember her skin,
Fragrant as amber, flower-scented.
Eyelids tremble with memories . . .
I am stricken by love's white flame!
The song sickened him. A tune for stupid creatures lost in sentimentality!
As well sing to the dune-impregnated corpse Alia had seen.
A figure moved in shadows of the balcony's grillwork. Paul whirled.
The ghola emerged into the sun's full glare. His metal eyes glittered.
"Is it Duncan Idaho or the man called Hayt?" Paul asked.
The ghola came to a stop two paces from him. "Which would my Lord prefer?"
The voice carried a soft ring of caution.
"Play the Zensunni," Paul said bitterly. Meanings within meanings! What
could a Zensunni philosopher say or do to change one jot of the reality
unrolling before them at this instant?
"My Lord is troubled."
Paul turned away, stared at the Shield Wall's distant scarp, saw wind-carved
arches and buttresses, terrible mimicry of his city. Nature playing a joke on
him! See what I can build! He recognized a slash in the distant massif, a place
where sand spilled from a crevasse, and thought: There! Right there, we fought
Sardaukar!
"What troubles my lord?" the ghola asked.
"A vision," Paul whispered.
"Ahhhhh, when the Tleilaxu first awakened me, I had visions. I was restless,
lonely . . . not really knowing I was lonely. Not then. My visions revealed
nothing! The Tleilaxu told me it was an intrusion of the flesh which men and
gholas all suffer, a sickness, no more."
Paul turned, studied the ghola's eyes, those pitted, steely balls without
expression. What visions did those eyes see?
"Duncan . . . Duncan . . ." Paul whispered.
"I am called Hayt."
"I saw a moon fall," Paul said. "It was gone, destroyed. I heard a great
hissing. The earth shook."
"You are drunk on too much time," the ghola said.
"I ask for the Zensunni and get the mentat!" Paul said. "Very well! Play my
vision through your logic, mentat. Analyze it and reduce it to mere words laid
out for burial."
"Burial, indeed," the ghola said. "You run from death. You strain at the
next instant, refuse to live here and now. Augury! What a crutch for an
Emperor!"
Paul found himself fascinated by a well-remembered mole on the ghola's chin.
"Trying to live in this future," the ghola said, "do you give substance to
such a future? Do you make it real?"
"If I go the way of my vision-future, I'll be alive then," Paul muttered.
"What makes you think I want to live there?"
The ghola shrugged. "You asked me for a substantial answer."
"Where is there substance in a universe composed of events?" Paul asked. "Is
there a final answer? Doesn't each solution produce new questions?"
"You've digested so much time you have delusions of immortality," the ghola
said. "Even your Empire, my lord, must live its time and die."
"Don't parade smoke-blackened altars before me," Paul growled. "I've heard
enough sad histories of gods and messiahs. Why should I need special powers to
forecast ruins of my own like all those others? The lowliest servant of my
kitchens could do this." He shook his head. "The moon fell!"
"You've not brought your mind to rest at its beginning," the ghola said.
"Is that how you destroy me?" Paul demanded. "Prevent me from collecting my
thoughts?"
"Can you collect chaos?" the ghola asked. "We Zensunni say: 'Not collecting,
that is the ultimate gathering.' What can you gather without gathering
yourself?"
"I'm deviled by a vision and you spew nonsense!" Paul raged. "What do you
know of prescience?"
"I've seen the oracle at work," the ghola said. "I've seen those who seek
signs and omens for their individual destiny. They fear what they seek."
"My falling moon is real," Paul whispered. He took a trembling breath. "It
moves. It moves."
"Men always fear things which move by themselves," the ghola said. "You fear
your own powers. Things fall into your head from nowhere. When they fall out,
where do they go?"
"You comfort me with thorns," Paul growled.
An inner illumination came over the ghola's face. For a moment, he became
pure Duncan Idaho. "I give you what comfort I can," he said.
Paul wondered at that momentary spasm. Had the ghola felt grief which his
mind rejected? Had Hayt put down a vision of his own?
"My moon has a name," Paul whispered.
He let the vision flow over him then. Though his whole being shrieked, no
sound escaped him. He was afraid to speak, fearful that his voice might betray
him. The air of this terrifying future was thick with Chani's absence. Flesh
that had cried in ecstasy, eyes that had burned him with their desire, the voice
that had charmed him because it played no tricks of subtle control -- all gone,
back into the water and the sand.
Slowly, Paul turned away, looked out at the present and the plaza before
Alia's temple. Three shaven-headed pilgrims entered from the processional
avenue. They wore grimy yellow robes and hurried with their heads bent against
the afternoon's wind. One walked with a limp, dragging his left foot. They beat
their way against the wind, rounded a corner and were gone from his sight.
Just as his moon would go, they were gone. Still, his vision lay before him.
Its terrible purpose gave him no choice.
The flesh surrenders itself, he thought. Eternity takes back its own. Our
bodies stirred these waters briefly, danced with a certain intoxication before
the love of life and self, dealt with a few strange ideas, then submitted to the
instruments of Time. What can we say of this? I occurred. I am not . . . yet, I
occurred.

"You do not beg the sun for mercy."
-Maud'dib's Travail from The Stilgar Commentary
One moment of incompetence can be fatal, the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen
Mohiam reminded herself.
She hobbled along, apparently unconcerned, within a ring of Fremen guards.
One of those behind her, she knew, was a deaf-mute immune to any wiles of Voice.
No doubt he'd been charged to kill her at the slightest provocation.
Why had Paul summoned her? she wondered. Was he about to pass sentence? She
remembered the day long ago when she'd tested him . . . the child kwisatz
haderach. He was a deep one.
Damn his mother for all eternity! It was her fault the Bene Gesserit had
lost their hold on this gene line.
Silence surged along the vaulted passages ahead of her entourage. She sensed
the word being passed. Paul would hear the silence. He'd know of her coming
before it was announced. She didn't delude herself with ideas that her powers
exceeded his.
Damn him!

She begrudged the burdens age had imposed on her: the aching joints,
responses not as quick as once they'd been, muscles not as elastic as the
whipcords of her youth. A long day lay behind her and a long life. She'd spent
this day with the Dune Tarot in a fruitless search for some clue to her own
fate. But the cards were sluggish.
The guards herded her around a corner into another of the seemingly endless
vaulted passages. Triangular meta-glass windows on her left gave a view upward
to trellised vines and indigo flowers in deep shadows cast by the afternoon sun.
Tiles lay underfoot -- figures of water creatures from exotic planets. Water
reminders everywhere. Wealth . . . riches.
Robed figures passed across another hall in front of her, cast covert
glances at the Reverend Mother. Recognition was obvious in their manner -- and
tension.
She kept her attention on the sharp hairline of the guard immediately in
front: young flesh, pink creases at the uniform collar.
The immensity of this ighir citadel began to impress her. Passages . . .
passages . . . They passed an open doorway from which emerged the sound of
timbur and flute playing soft, elder music. A glance showed her blue-in-blue
Fremen eyes staring from the room. She sensed in them the ferment of legendary
revolts stirring in wild genes.
There lay the measure of her personal burden, she knew. A Bene Gesserit
could not escape awareness of the genes and their possibilities. She was touched
by a feeling of loss: that stubborn fool of an Atreides! How could he deny the
jewels of posterity within his loins? A kwisatz haderach! Born out of this time,
true, but real -- as real as his abomination of a sister . . . and there lay a
dangerous unknown. A wild Reverend Mother spawned without Bene Gesserit
inhibitions, holding no loyalty to orderly development of the genes. She shared
her brother's powers, no doubt -- and more.
The size of the citadel began to oppress her. Would the passages never end?
The place reeked of terrifying physical power. No planet, no civilization in all
human history had ever before seen such man-made immensity. A dozen ancient
cities could be hidden in its walls!
They passed oval doors with winking lights. She recognized them for Ixian
handiwork: pneumatic transport orifices. Why was she being marched all this
distance, then? The answer began to shape itself in her mind: to oppress her in
preparation for this audience with the Emperor.
A small clue, but it joined other subtle indications -- the relative
suppression and selection of words by her escort, the traces of primitive
shyness in their eyes when they called her Reverend Mother, the cold and bland,
essentially odorless nature of these halls -- all combined to reveal much that a
Bene Gesserit could interpret.
Paul wanted something from her!
She concealed a feeling of elation. A bargaining lever existed. It remained
only to find the nature of that lever and test its strength. Some levers had
moved things greater than this citadel. A finger's touch had been known to
topple civilizations.
The Reverend Mother reminded herself then of Scytale's assessment: When a
creature has developed into one thing, he will choose death rather than change
into his opposite.
The passages through which she was being escorted grew larger by subtle
stages -- tricks of arching, graduated amplification of pillared supports,
displacement of the triangular windows by larger, oblong shapes. Ahead of her,
finally, loomed double doors centered in the far wall of a tall antechamber. She
sensed that the doors were very large, and was forced to suppress a gasp as her
trained awareness measured out the true proportions. The doorway stood at least
eighty meters high, half that in width.

As she approached with her escort, the doors swung inward -- an immense and
silent movement of hidden machinery. She recognized more Ixian handiwork.
Through that towering doorway she marched with her guards into the Grand
Reception Hall of the Emperor Paul Atreides -- "Muad'dib, before whom all people
are dwarfed." Now, she saw the effect of that popular saying at work.
As she advanced toward Paul on the distant throne, the Reverend Mother found
herself more impressed by the architectural subtleties of her surroundings than
she was by the immensities. The space was large: it could've housed the entire
citadel of any ruler in human history. The open sweep of the room said much
about hidden structural forces balanced with nicety. Trusses and supporting
beams behind these walls and the faraway domed ceiling must surpass anything
ever before attempted. Everything spoke of engineering genius.
Without seeming to do so, the hall grew smaller at its far end, refusing to
dwarf Paul on his throne centered on a dais. An untrained awareness, shocked by
surrounding proportions, would see him at first as many times larger than his
actual size. Colors played upon the unprotected psyche: Paul's green throne had
been cut from a single Hagar emerald. It suggested growing things and, out of
the Fremen mythos, reflected the mourning color. It whispered that here sat he
who could make you mourn -- life and death in one symbol, a clever stress of
opposites. Behind the throne, draperies cascaded in burnt orange, curried gold
of Dune earth, and cinnamon flecks of melange. To a trained eye, the symbolism
was obvious, but it contained hammer blows to beat down the uninitiated.
Time played its role here.
The Reverend Mother measured the minutes required to approach the Imperial
Presence at her hobbling pace. You had time to be cowed. Any tendency toward
resentment would be squeezed out of you by the unbridled power which focused
down upon your person. You might start the long march toward that throne as a
human of dignity, but you ended the march as a gnat.
Aides and attendants stood around the Emperor in a curiously ordered
sequence -- attentive household guardsmen along the draped back wall, that
abomination, Alia, two steps below Paul and on his left hand; Stilgar, the
Imperial lackey, on the step directly below Alia; and on the right, one step up
from the floor of the hall, a solitary figure: the fleshly revenant of Duncan
Idaho, the ghola. She marked older Fremen among the guardsmen, bearded Naibs
with stillsuit scars on their noses, sheathed crysknives at their waists, a few
maula pistols, even some lasguns. Those most be trusted men, she thought, to
carry lasguns in Paul's presence when he obviously wore a shield generator. She
could see the shimmering of its field around him. One burst of a lasgun into
that field and the entire citadel would be a hole in the ground.
Her guard stopped ten paces from the foot of the dais, parted to open an
unobstructed view of the Emperor. She noted now the absence of Chani and Irulan,
wondered at it. He held no important audience without them, so it was said.
Paul nodded to her, silent, measuring.
Immediately, she decided to take the offensive, said: "So, the great Paul
Atreides deigns to see the one he banished."
Paul smiled wryly, thinking: She knows I want something from her. That
knowledge had been inevitable, she being who she was. He recognized her powers.
The Bene Gesserit didn't become Reverend Mothers by chance.
"Shall we dispense with fencing?" he asked.
Would it be this easy? she wondered. And she said: "Name the thing you
want."
Stilgar stirred, cast a sharp glance at Paul. The Imperial lackey didn't
like her tone.
"Stilgar wants me to send you away," Paul said.
"Not kill me?" she asked. "I would've expected something more direct from a
Fremen Naib."
Stilgar scowled, said: "Often, I must speak otherwise than I think. That is
called diplomacy."
"Then let us dispense with diplomacy as well," she said. "Was it necessary
to have me walk all that distance. I am an old woman."
"You had to be shown how callous I can be," Paul said. "That way, you'll
appreciate magnanimity."
"You dare such gaucheries with a Bene Gesserit?" she asked.
"Gross actions carry their own messages," Paul said.
She hesitated, weighed his words. So -- he might yet dispense with her . . .
grossly, obviously, if she . . . if she what?
"Say what it is you want from me," she muttered.
Alia glanced at her brother, nodded toward the draperies behind the throne.
She knew Paul's reasoning in this, but disliked it all the same. Call it wild
prophecy: She felt pregnant with reluctance to take part in this bargaining.
"You must be careful how you speak to me, old woman," Paul said.
He called me old woman when he was a stripling, the Reverend Mother thought.
Does he remind me now of my hand in his past? The decision I made then, must I
remake it here? She felt the weight of decision, a physical thing that set her
knees to trembling. Muscles cried their fatigue.
"It was a long walk," Paul said, "and I can see that you're tired. We will
retire to my private chamber behind the throne. You may sit there." He gave a
hand-signal to Stilgar, arose.
Stilgar and the ghola converged on her, helped her up the steps, followed
Paul through a passage concealed by the draperies. She realized then why he had
greeted her in the hall: a dumb-show for the guards and Naibs. He feared them,
then. And now -- now, he displayed kindly benevolence, daring such wiles on a
Bene Gesserit. Or was it daring? She sensed another presence behind, glanced
back to see Alia following. The younger woman's eyes held a brooding, baleful
cast. The Reverend Mother shuddered.
The private chamber at the end of the passage was a twenty-meter cube of
plasmeld, yellow glowglobes for light, the deep orange hangings of a desert
stilltent around the walls. It contained divans, soft cushions, a faint odor of
melange, crystal water flagons on a low table. It felt cramped, tiny after the
outer hall.
Paul seated her on a divan, stood over her, studying the ancient face -steely teeth, eyes that hid more than they revealed, deeply wrinkled skin. He
indicated a water flagon. She shook her head, dislodging a wisp of gray hair.
In a low voice, Paul said: "I wish to bargain with you for the life of my
beloved."
Stilgar cleared his throat.
Alia fingered the handle of the crysknife sheathed at her neck.
The ghola remained at the door, face impassive, metal eyes pointed at the
air above the Reverend Mother's head.
"Have you had a vision of my hand in her death?" the Reverend Mother asked.
She kept her attention on the ghola, oddly disturbed by him. Why should she feel
threatened by the ghola? He was a tool of the conspiracy.
"I know what it is you want from me," Paul said, avoiding her question.
Then he only suspects, she thought. The Reverend Mother looked down at the
tips of her shoes exposed by a fold of her robe. Black . . . black . . . shoes
and robe showed marks of her confinement: stains, wrinkles. She lifted her chin,
met an angry glare in Paul's eyes. Elation surged through her, but she hid the
emotion behind pursed lips, slitted eyelids.
"What coin do you offer?" she asked.
"You may have my seed, but not my person," Paul said. "Irulan banished and
inseminated by artificial --"
"You dare!" the Reverend Mother flared, stiffening.
Stilgar took a half step forward.

Disconcertingly, the ghola smiled. And now Alia was studying him.
"We'll not discuss the things your Sisterhood forbids," Paul said. "I will
listen to no talk of sins, abominations or the beliefs left over from past
Jihads. You may have my seed for your plans, but no child of Irulan's will sit
on my throne."
"Your throne," she sneered.
"My throne."
"Then who will bear the Imperial heir?"
"Chani."
"She is barren."
"She is with child."
An involuntary indrawn breath exposed her shock. "You lie!" she snapped.
Paul held up a restraining hand as Stilgar surged forward.
"We've known for two days that she carries my child."
"But Irulan . . . "
"By artificial means only. That's my offer."
The Reverend Mother closed her eyes to hide his face. Damnation! To cast the
genetic dice in such a way! Loathing boiled in her breast. The teaching of the
Bene Gesserit, the lessons of the Butlerian Jihad -- all proscribed such an act.
One did not demean the highest aspirations of humankind. No machine could
function in the way of a human mind. No word or deed could imply that men might
be bred on the level of animals.
"Your decision," Paul said.
She shook her head. The genes, the precious Atreides genes -- only these
were important. Need went deeper than proscription. For the Sisterhood, mating
mingled more than sperm and ovum. One aimed to capture the psyche.
The Reverend Mother understood now the subtle depths of Paul's offer. He
would make the Bene Gesserit party to an act which would bring down popular
wrath . . . were it ever discovered. They could not admit such paternity if the
Emperor denied it. This coin might save the Atreides genes for the Sisterhood,
but it would never buy a throne.
She swept her gaze around the room, studying each face: Stilgar, passive and
waiting now; the ghola frozen at some inward place; Alia watching the ghola . .
. and Paul -- wrath beneath a shallow veneer.
"This is your only offer?" she asked.
"My only offer."
She glanced at the ghola, caught by a brief movement of muscles across his
cheeks. Emotion? "You, ghola," she said. "Should such an offer be made? Having
been made, should it be accepted? Function as the mentat for us."
The metallic eyes turned to Paul.
"Answer as you will," Paul said.
The ghola returned his gleaming attention to the Reverend Mother, shocked
her once more by smiling. "An offer is only as good as the real thing it buys,"
he said. "The exchange offered here is life-for-life, a high order of business."
Alia brushed a strand of coppery hair from her forehead, said: "And what
else is hidden in this bargain?"
The Reverend Mother refused to look at Alia, but the words burned in her
mind. Yes, far deeper implications lay here. The sister was an abomination,
true, but there could be no denying her status as a Reverend Mother with all the
title implied. Gaius Helen Mohiam felt herself in this instant to be not one
single person, but all the others who sat like tiny congeries in her memory.
They were alert, every Reverend Mother she had absorbed in becoming a Priestess
of the Sisterhood. Alia would be standing in the same situation here.
"What else?" the ghola asked. "One wonders why the witches of the Bene
Gesserit have not used Tleilaxu methods."
Gaius Helen Mohiam and all the Reverend Mothers within her shuddered. Yes,
the Tleilaxu did loathsome things. If one let down the barriers to artificial
insemination, was the next step a Tleilaxu one -- controlled mutation?
Paul, observing the play of emotion around him, felt abruptly that he no
longer knew these people. He could see only strangers. Even Alia was a stranger.
Alia said: "If we set the Atreides genes adrift in a Bene Gesserit river,
who knows what may result?"
Gaius Helen Mohiam's head snapped around, and she met Alia's gaze. For a
flashing instant, they were two Reverend Mothers together, communing on a single
thought: What lay behind any Tleilaxu action? The ghola was a Tleilaxu thing.
Had he put this plan into Paul's mind? Would Paul attempt to bargain directly
with the Bene Tleilaxu?
She broke her gaze from Alia's, feeling her own ambivalence and
inadequacies. The pitfall of Bene Gesserit training, she reminded herself, lay
in the powers granted: such powers predisposed one to vanity and pride. But
power deluded those who used it. One tended to believe power could overcome any
barrier . . . including one's own ignorance.
Only one thing stood paramount here for the Bene Gesserit, she told herself.
That was the pyramid of generations which had reached an apex in Paul Atreides .
. . and in his abomination of a sister. A wrong choice here and the pyramid
would have to be rebuilt . . . starting generations back in the parallel lines
and with breeding specimens lacking the choicest characteristics.
Controlled mutation, she thought. Did the Tleilaxu really practice it? How
tempting! She shook her head, the better to rid it of such thoughts.
"You reject my proposal?" Paul asked.
"I'm thinking," she said.
And again, she looked at the sister. The optimum cross for this female
Atreides had been lost . . . killed by Paul. Another possibility remained,
however -- one which would cement the desired characteristic into an offspring.
Paul dared offer animal breeding to the Bene Gesserit! How much was he really
prepared to pay for his Chani's life? Would he accept a cross with his own
sister?
Sparring for time, the Reverend Mother said: "Tell me, oh flawless exemplar
of all that's holy, has Irulan anything to say of your proposal?"
"Irulan will do what you tell her to do," Paul growled.
True enough, Mohiam thought. She firmed her jaw, offered a new gambit:
"There are two Atreides."
Paul, sensing something of what lay in the old witch's mind, felt blood
darken his face. "Careful what you suggest," he said.
"You'd just use Irulan to gain your own ends, eh?" she asked.
"Wasn't she trained to be used?" Paul asked.
And we trained her, that's what he's saying, Mohiam thought. Well . . .
Irulan's a divided coin. Was there another way to spend such a coin?
"Will you put Chani's child on the throne?" the Reverend Mother asked.
"On my throne." Paul said. He glanced at wondering suddenly if she knew the
divergent possibilities in this exchange. Alia stood with eyes closed, an odd
stillness-of-person about her. With what inner force did she commune? Seeing his
sister thus, Paul felt he'd been cast adrift. Alia stood on a shore that was
receding from him.
The Reverend Mother made her decision, said: "This is too much for one
person to decide. I must consult with my Council on Wallach. Will you permit a
message?"
As though she needed my permission! Paul thought.
He said: "Agreed, then. But don't delay too long. I will not sit idly by
while you debate."
"Will you bargain with the Bene Tleilaxu?" the ghola asked, his voice a
sharp intrusion.

Alia's eyes popped open and she stared at the ghola as though she'd been
wakened by a dangerous intruder.
"I've made no such decision," Paul said. "What I will do is go into the
desert as soon as it can be arranged. Our child will be born in sietch."
"A wise decision," Stilgar intoned.
Alia refused to look at Stilgar. It was a wrong decision. She could feel
this in every cell. Paul must know it. Why had he fixed himself upon such a
path?
"Have the Bene Tleilaxu offered their services?" Alia asked. She saw Mohiam
hanging on the answer.
Paul shook his head. "No." He glanced at Stilgar. "Stil, arrange for the
message to be sent to Wallach."
"At once, m'Lord."
Paul turned away, waited while Stilgar summoned guards, left with the old
witch. He sensed Alia debating whether to confront him with more questions. She
turned, instead, to the ghola.
"Mentat," she said, "will the Tleilaxu bid for favor with my brother?"
The ghola shrugged.
Paul felt his attention wander. The Tleilaxu? No . . . not in the way Alia
meant. Her question revealed, though, that she had not seen the alternatives
here. Well . . . vision varied from sibyl to sibyl. Why not a variance from
brother to sister? Wandering . . . wandering . . . He came back from each
thought with a start to pick up shards of the nearby conversation.
" . . . must know what the Tleilaxu . . ."
" . . . the fullness of data is always . . ."
" . . . healthy doubts where . . . "
Paul turned, looked at his sister, caught her attention. He knew she would
see tears on his face and wonder at them. Let her wonder. Wondering was a
kindness now. He glanced at the ghola, seeing only Duncan Idaho despite the
metallic eyes. Sorrow and compassion warred in Paul. What might those metal eyes
record?
There are many degrees of sight and many degrees of blindness, Paul thought.
His mind turned to a paraphrase of the passage from the Orange Catholic Bible:
'What senses do we lack that we cannot see another world all around us?'
Were those metal eyes another sense than sight?
Alia crossed to her brother, sensing his utter sadness. She touched a tear
on his cheek with a Fremen gesture of awe, said: "We must not grieve for those
dear to us before their passing."
"Before their passing," Paul whispered. "Tell me, little sister, what is
before?"

"I've had a bellyful of the god and priest business! You think I don't see my
own mythos? Consult your data once more, Hayt. I've insinuated my rites into the
most elementary human acts. The people eat in the name of Muad'dib! They make
love in my name, are born in my name -- cross the street in my name. A roof beam
cannot be raised in the lowliest hovel of far Gangishree without invoking the
blessing of Muad'dib!"
-Book of Diatribes from The Hayt Chronicle
"You risk much leaving your post and coming to me here at this time," Edric
said, glaring through the walls of his tank at the Face Dancer.
"How weak and narrow is your thinking," Scytale said. "Who is it who comes
to visit you?"
Edric hesitated, observing the hulk shape, heavy eyelids, blunt face. It was
early in the day and Edric's metabolism had not yet cycled from night repose
into full melange consumption.
"This is not the shape which walked the streets?" Edric asked.
"One would not look twice at some of the figures I have been today," Scytale
said.
The chameleon thinks a change of shape will hide him from anything, Edric
thought with rare insight. And he wondered if his presence in the conspiracy
truly hid them from all oracular powers. The Emperor's sister, now . . .
Edric shook his head, stirring the orange gas of his tank, said: "Why are
you here?"
"The gift must be prodded to swifter action," Scytale said.
"That cannot be done."
"A way must be found," Scytale insisted.
"Why?"
"Things are not to my liking. The Emperor is trying to split us. Already he
has made his bid to the Bene Gesserit."
"Oh, that."
"That! You must prod the ghola to . . . "
"You fashioned him, Tleilaxu," Edric said. "You know better than to ask
this." He paused, moved closer to the transparent wall of his tank. "Or did you
lie to us about this gift?"
"Lie?"
"You said the weapon was to be aimed and released, nothing more. Once the
ghola was given we could not tamper."
"Any ghola can be disturbed," Scytale said. "You need do nothing more than
question him about his original being."
"What will this do?"
"It will stir him to actions which will serve our purposes."
"He is a mentat with powers of logic and reason," Edric objected. "He may
guess what I'm doing . . . or the sister. If her attention is focused upon --"
"Do you hide us from the sibyl or don't you?" Scytale asked.
"I'm not afraid of oracles," Edric said. "I'm concerned with logic, with
real spies, with the physical powers of the Imperium, with the control of the
spice, with --"
"One can contemplate the Emperor and his powers comfortably if one remembers
that all things are Finite," Scytale said.
Oddly, the Steersman recoiled in agitation, threshing his limbs like some
weird newt. Scytale fought a sense of loathing at the sight. The Guild Navigator
wore his usual dark leotard bulging at the belt with various containers. Yet . .
. he gave the impression of nakedness when he moved. It was the swimming,
reaching movements, Scytale decided, and he was struck once more by the delicate
linkages of their conspiracy. They were not a compatible group. That was
weakness.
Edric's agitation subsided. He stared out at Scytale, vision colored by the
orange gas which sustained him. What plot did the Face Dancer hold in reserve to
save himself? Edric wondered. The Tleilaxu was not acting in a predictable
fashion. Evil omen.
Something in the Navigator's voice and actions told Scytale that the
Guildsman feared the sister more than the Emperor. This was an abrupt thought
flashed on the screen of awareness. Disturbing. Had they overlooked something
important about Alia? Would the ghola be sufficient weapon to destroy both?
"You know what is said of Alia?" Scytale asked, probing.
"What do you mean?" Again, the fish-man was agitated.
"Never have philosophy and culture had such a patroness," Scytale said.
"Pleasure and beauty unite in --"
"What is enduring about beauty and pleasure?" Edric demanded. "We will
destroy both Atreides. Culture! They dispense culture the better to rule.
Beauty! They promote the beauty which enslaves. They create a literate ignorance
-- easiest thing of all. They leave nothing to chance. Chains! Everything they
do forges chains, enslaves. But slaves always revolt."
"The sister may wed and produce offspring," Scytale said.
"Why do you speak of the sister?" Edric asked.
"The Emperor may choose a mate for her," Scytale said.
"Let him choose. Already, it is too late."
"Even you cannot invent the next moment," Scytale warned. "You are not a
creator . . . any more than are the Atreides." He nodded. "We must not presume
too much."
"We aren't the ones to flap our tongues about creation," Edric protested.
"We aren't the rabble trying to make a messiah out of Muad'dib. What is this
nonsense? Why are you raising such questions?"
"It's this planet," Scytale said. "It raises questions."
"Planets don't speak!"
"This one does."
"Oh?"
"It speaks of creation. Sand blowing in the night, that is creation."
"Sand blowing . . . "
"When you awaken, the first light shows you the new world -- all fresh and
ready for your tracks."
Untracked sand? Edric thought. Creation? He felt knotted with sudden
anxiety. The confinement of his tank, the surrounding room, everything closed in
upon him, constricted him.
Tracks in sand.
"You talk like a Fremen," Edric said.
"This is a Fremen thought and it's instructive," Scytale agreed. "They speak
of Muad'dib's Jihad as leaving tracks in the universe in the same way that a
Fremen tracks new sand. They've marked out a trail in men's lives."
"So?"
"Another night comes," Scytale said. "Winds blow."
"Yes," Edric said, "the Jihad is finite. Muad'dib has used his Jihad and --"
"He didn't use the Jihad," Scytale said. "The Jihad used him. I think he
would've stopped it if he could."
"If he could? All he had to do was --"
"Oh, be still!" Scytale barked. "You can't stop a mental epidemic. It leaps
from person to person across parsecs. It's overwhelmingly contagious. It strikes
at the unprotected side, in the place where we lodge the fragments of other such
plagues. Who can stop such a thing? Muad'dib hasn't the antidote. The thing has
roots in chaos. Can orders reach there?"
"Have you been infected, then?" Edric asked. He turned slowly in the orange
gas, wondering why Scytale's words carried such a tone of fear. Had the Face
Dancer broken from the conspiracy? There was no way to peer into the future and
examine this now. The future had become a muddy stream, clogged with prophets.
"We're all contaminated," Scytale said, and he reminded himself that Edric's
intelligence had severe limits. How could this point be made that the Guildsman
would understand it?
"But when we destroy him," Edric said, "the contag --"
"I should leave you in this ignorance," Scytale said. "But my duties will
not permit it. Besides, it's dangerous to all of us."
Edric recoiled, steadied himself with a kick of one webbed foot which sent
the orange gas whipping around his legs. "You speak strangely," he said.
"This whole thing is explosive," Scytale said in a calmer voice. "It's ready
to shatter. When it goes, it will send bits of itself out through the centuries.
Don't you see this?"
"We've dealt with religions before," Edric protested. "If this new --"
"It is not just a religion!" Scytale said, wondering what the Reverend
Mother would say to this harsh education of their fellow conspirator. "Religious
government is something else. Muad'dib has crowded his Qizarate in everywhere,
displaced the old functions of government. But he has no permanent civil
service, no interlocking embassies. He has bishoprics, islands of authority. At
the center of each island is a man. Men learn how to gain and hold personal
power. Men are jealous."
"When they're divided, we'll absorb them one by one," Edric said with a
complacent smile. "Cut off the head and the body will fall to --"
"This body has two heads," Scytale said.
"The sister -- who may wed."
"Who will certainly wed."
"I don't like your tone, Scytale."
"And I don't like your ignorance."
"What if she does wed? Will that shake our plans?"
"It will shake the universe."
"But they're not unique. I, myself, possess powers which --"
"You're an infant. You toddle where they stride."
"They are not unique!"
"You forget, Guildsman, that we once made a kwisatz haderach. This is a
being filled by the spectacle of Time. It is a form of existence which cannot be
threatened without enclosing yourself in the identical threat. Muad'dib knows we
would attack his Chani. We must move faster than we have. You must get to the
ghola, prod him as I have instructed."
"And if I do not?"
"We will feel the thunderbolt."
= = = = = =
Oh, worm of many teeth,
Canst thou deny what has no cure?
The flesh and breath which lure thee
To the ground of all beginnings
Feed on monsters twisting in a door of fire!
Thou hast no robe in all thy attire
To cover intoxications of divinity
Or hide the burnings of desire!
-Wormsong from the Dunebook
Paul had worked up a sweat on the practice floor using crysknife and short
sword against the ghola. He stood now at a window looking down into the temple
plaza, tried to imagine the scene with Chani at the clinic. She'd been taken ill
at midmorning, the sixth week of her pregnancy. The medics were the best. They'd
call when they had news.
Murky afternoon sandclouds darkened the sky over the plaza. Fremen called
such weather "dirty air."
Would the medics never call? Each second struggled past, reluctant to enter
his universe.
Waiting . . . waiting . . . The Bene Gesserit sent no word from Wallach.
Deliberately delaying, of course.
Prescient vision had recorded these moments, but he shielded his awareness
from the oracle, preferring the role here of a Timefish swimming not where he
willed, but where the currents carried him. Destiny permitted no struggles now.
The ghola could be heard racking weapons, examining the equipment. Paul
sighed, put a hand to his own belt, deactivated his shield. The tingling passage
of its field ran down against his skin.

He'd face events when Chani came, Paul told himself. Time enough then to
accept the fact that what he'd concealed from her had prolonged her life. Was it
evil, he wondered, to prefer Chani to an heir? By what right did he make her
choice for her? Foolish thoughts! Who could hesitate, given the alternatives -slave pits, torture, agonizing sorrow . . . and worse.
He heard the door open, Chani's footsteps.
Paul turned.
Murder sat on Chani's face. The wide Fremen belt which gathered the waist of
her golden robe, the water rings worn as a necklace, one hand at her hip (never
far from the knife), the trenchant stare which was her first inspection of any
room -- everything about her stood now only as a background for violence.
He opened his arms as she came to him, gathered her close.
"Someone," she rasped, speaking against his breast, "has been feeding me a
contraceptive for a long time . . . before I began the new diet. There'll be
problems with this birth because of it."
"But there are remedies?" he asked.
"Dangerous remedies. I know the source of that poison! I'll have her blood."
"My Sihaya," he whispered, holding her close to calm a sudden trembling.
"You'll bear the heir we want. Isn't that enough?"
"My life burns faster," she said, pressing against him. "The birth now
controls my life. The medics told me it goes at a terrible pace. I must eat and
eat . . . and take more spice, as well . . . eat it, drink it. I'll kill her for
this!"
Paul kissed her cheek. "No, my Sihaya. You'll kill no one." And he thought:
Irulan prolonged your life, beloved. For you, the time of birth is the time of
death.
He felt hidden grief drain his marrow then, empty his life into a black
flask.
Chani pushed away from him. "She cannot be forgiven!"
"Who said anything about forgiving?"
"They why shouldn't I kill her?"
It was such a flat, Fremen question that Paul felt himself almost overcome
by a hysterical desire to laugh. He covered it by saying: "It wouldn't help."
"You've seen that?"
Paul felt his belly tighten with vision-memory.
"What I've seen . . . what I've seen . . ." he muttered. Every aspect of
surrounding events fitted a present which paralyzed him. He felt chained to a
future which, exposed too often, had locked onto him like a greedy succubus.
Tight dryness clogged his throat. Had he followed the witchcall of his own
oracle, he wondered, until it'd spilled him into a merciless present?
"Tell me what you've seen," Chani said.
"I can't."
"Why mustn't I kill her?"
"Because I ask it."
He watched her accept this. She did it the way sand accepted water:
absorbing and concealing. Was there obedience beneath that hot, angry surface?
he wondered. And he realized then that life in the royal Keep had left Chani
unchanged. She'd merely stopped here for a time, inhabited a way station on a
journey with her man. Nothing of the desert had been taken from her.
Chani stepped away from him then, glanced at the ghola who stood waiting
near the diamond circle of the practice door.
"You've been crossing blades with him?" she asked.
"And I'm better for it."
Her gaze went to the circle on the floor, back to the ghola's metallic eyes.
"I don't like it," she said.
"He's not intended to do me violence," Paul said.
"You've seen that?"
"I've not seen it!"
"Then how do you know?"
"Because he's more than ghola; he's Duncan Idaho."
"The Bene Tleilax made him."
"They made more than they intended."
She shook her head. A corner of her nezhoni scarf rubbed the collar of her
robe. "How can you change the fact that he is ghola?"
"Hayt," Paul said, "are you the tool of my undoing?"
"If the substance of here and now is changed, the future is changed," the
ghola said.
"That is no answer!" Chani objected.
Paul raised his voice: "How will I die, Hayt?"
Light glinted from the artificial eyes. "It is said, m'Lord, that you will
die of money and power."
Chani stiffened. "How dare he speak thus to you?"
"The mentat is truthful," Paul said.
"Was Duncan Idaho a real friend?" she asked.
"He gave his life for me."
"It is sad," Chani whispered, "that a ghola cannot be restored to his
original being."
"Would you convert me?" the ghola asked, directing his gaze to Chani.
"What does he mean?" Chani asked.
"To be converted is to be turned around," Paul said. "But there's no going
back."
"Every man carries his own past with him," Hayt said.
"And every ghola?" Paul asked.
"In a way, m'Lord."
"Then what of that past in your secret flesh?" Paul asked.
Chani saw how the question disturbed the ghola. His movements quickened,
hands clenched into fists. She glanced at Paul, wondering why he probed thus.
Was there a way to restore this creature to the man he'd been?
"Has a ghola ever remembered his real past?" Chani asked.
"Many attempts have been made," Hayt said, his gaze fixed on the floor near
his feet. "No ghola has ever been restored to his former being."
"But you long for this to happen," Paul said.
The blank surfaces of the ghola's eyes came up to center on Paul with a
pressing intensity. "Yes!"
Voice soft, Paul said: "If there's a way . . ."
"This flesh," Hayt said, touching left hand to forehead in a curious
saluting movement, "is not the flesh of my original birth. It is . . . reborn.
Only the shape is familiar. A Face Dancer might do as well."
"Not as well," Paul said. "And you're not a Face Dancer."
"That is true, m'Lord."
"Whence comes your shape?"
"The genetic imprint of the original cells."
"Somewhere," Paul said, "there's a plastic something which remembers the
shape of Duncan Idaho. It's said the ancients probed this region before the
Butlerian Jihad. What's the extent of this memory, Hayt? What did it learn from
the original?"
The ghola shrugged.
"What if he wasn't Idaho?" Chani asked.
"He was."
"Can you be certain?" she asked.
"He is Duncan in every aspect. I cannot imagine a force strong enough to
hold that shape thus without any relaxation or any deviation."
"M'Lord!" Hayt objected. "Because we cannot imagine a thing, that doesn't
exclude it from reality. There are things I must do as a ghola that I would not
do as a man."
Keeping his attention on Chani, Paul said: "You see?" She nodded.
Paul turned away, fighting deep sadness. He crossed to the balcony windows,
drew the draperies. Lights came on in the sudden gloom. He pulled the sash of
his robe tight, listened for sounds behind him.
Nothing.
He turned. Chani stood as though entranced, her gaze centered on the ghola.
Hayt, Paul saw, had retreated to some inner chamber of his being -- had gone
back to the ghola place.
Chani turned at the sound of Paul's return. She still felt the thralldom of
the instant Paul had precipitated. For a brief moment, the ghola had been an
intense, vital human being. For that moment, he had been someone she did not
fear -- indeed, someone she liked and admired. Now, she understood Paul's
purpose in this probing. He had wanted her to see the man in the ghola flesh.
She stared at Paul. "That man, was that Duncan Idaho?"
"That was Duncan Idaho. He is still there."
"Would he have allowed Irulan to go on living?" Chani asked.
The water didn't sink too deep, Paul thought. And he said: "If I commanded
it."
"I don't understand," she said. "Shouldn't you be angry?"
"I am angry."
"You don't sound . . . angry. You sound sorrowful."
He closed his eyes. "Yes. That, too."
"You're my man," she said. "I know this, but suddenly I don't understand
you."
Abruptly, Paul felt that he walked down a long cavern. His flesh moved -one foot and then another -- but his thoughts went elsewhere. "I don't
understand myself," he whispered. When he opened his eyes, he found that he had
moved away from Chani.
She spoke from somewhere behind him. "Beloved, I'll not ask again what
you've seen. I only know I'm to give you the heir we want."
He nodded, then: "I've known that from the beginning." He turned, studied
her. Chani seemed very far away.
She drew herself up, placed a hand on her abdomen. "I'm hungry. The medics
tell me I must eat three or four times what I ate before. I'm frightened,
beloved. It goes too fast."
Too fast, he agreed. This fetus knows the necessity for speed.
= = = = = =
The audacious nature of Muad'dib's actions may be seen in the fact that He knew
from the beginning whither He was bound, yet not once did He step aside from
that path. He put it clearly when He said: "I tell you that I come now to my
time of testing when it will be shown that I am the Ultimate Servant." Thus He
weaves all into One, that both friend and foe may worship Him. It is for this
reason and this reason only that His Apostles prayed: "Lord, save us from the
other paths which Muad'dib covered with the Waters of His Life. " Those "other
paths" may be imagined only with the deepest revulsion.
-from The Yiam-el-Din (Book of Judgment)
The messenger was a young woman -- her face, name and family known to Chani
-- which was how she'd penetrated Imperial Security.
Chani had done no more than identify her for a Security Officer named
Bannerjee, who then arranged the meeting with Muad'dib. Bannerjee acted out of
instinct and the assurance that the young woman's father had been a member of
the Emperor's Death Commandos, the dreaded Fedaykin, in the days before the
Jihad. Otherwise, he might have ignored her plea that her message was intended
only for the ears of Muad'dib.
She was, of course, screened and searched before the meeting in Paul's
private office. Even so, Bannerjee accompanied her, hand on knife, other hand on
her arm.
It was almost midday when they brought her into the room -- an odd space,
mixture of desert-Fremen and Family-Aristocrat. Hiereg hangings lined three
walls: delicate tapestries adorned with figures out of Fremen mythology. A view
screen covered the fourth wall, a silver-gray surface behind an oval desk whose
top held only one object, a Fremen sandclock built into an orrery. The orrery, a
suspensor mechanism from lx, carried both moons of Arrakis in the classic Worm
Trine aligned with the sun.
Paul, standing beside the desk, glanced at Bannerjee. The Security Officer
was one of those who'd come up through the Fremen Constabulary, winning his
place on brains and proven loyalty despite the smuggler ancestry attested by his
name. He was a solid figure, almost fat. Wisps of black hair fell down over the
dark, wet-appearing skin of his forehead like the crest of an exotic bird. His
eyes were blue-blue and steady in a gaze which could look upon happiness or
atrocity without change of expression. Both Chani and Stilgar trusted him. Paul
knew that if he told Bannerjee to throttle the girl immediately, Bannerjee would
do it.
"Sire, here is the messenger girl," Bannerjee said. "M'Lady Chani said she
sent word to you."
"Yes." Paul nodded curtly.
Oddly, the girl didn't look at him. Her attention remained on the orrery.
She was dark-skinned, of medium height, her figure concealed beneath a robe
whose rich wine fabric and simple cut spoke of wealth. Her blue-black hair was
held in a narrow band of material which matched the robe. The robe concealed her
hands. Paul suspected that the hands were tightly clasped. It would be in
character. Everything about her would be in character -- including the robe: a
last piece of finery saved for such a moment.
Paul motioned Bannerjee aside. He hesitated before obeying. Now, the girl
moved -- one step forward. When she moved there was grace. Still, her eyes
avoided him.
Paul cleared his throat.
Now the girl lifted her gaze, the whiteless eyes widening with just the
right shade of awe. She had an odd little face with delicate chin, a sense of
reserve in the way she held her small mouth. The eyes appeared abnormally large
above slanted cheeks. There was a cheerless air about her, something which said
she seldom smiled. The corners of her eyes even held a faint yellow misting
which could have been from dust irritation or the tracery of semuta.
Everything was in character.
"You asked to see me," Paul said.
The moment of supreme test for this girl-shape had come. Scytale had put on
the shape, the mannerisms, the sex, the voice -- everything his abilities could
grasp and assume. But this was a female known to Muad'dib in the sietch days.
She'd been a child, then, but she and Muad'dib shared common experiences.
Certain areas of memory must be avoided delicately. It was the most exacting
part Scytale had ever attempted.
"I am Otheym's Lichna of Berk al Dib."
The girl's voice came out small, but firm, giving name, father and pedigree.
Paul nodded. He saw how Chani had been fooled. The timbre of voice,
everything reproduced with exactitude. Had it not been for his own Bene Gesserit
training in voice and for the web of dao in which oracular vision enfolded him,
this Face-Dancer disguise might have gulled even him.

Training exposed certain discrepancies: the girl was older than her known
years; too much control tuned the vocal cords; set of neck and shoulders missed
by a fraction the subtle hauteur of Fremen poise. But there were niceties, too:
the rich robe had been patched to betray actual status . . . and the features
were beautifully exact. They spoke a certain sympathy of this Face Dancer for
the role being played.
"Rest in my home, daughter of Otheym," Paul said in formal Fremen greeting.
"You are welcome as water after a dry crossing."
The faintest of relaxations exposed the confidence this apparent acceptance
had conveyed.
"I bring a message," she said.
"A man's messenger is as himself," Paul said.
Scytale breathed softly. It went well, but now came the crucial task: the
Atreides must be guided onto that special path. He must lose his Fremen
concubine in circumstances where no other shared the blame. The failure must
belong only to the omnipotent Muad'dib. He had to be led into an ultimate
realization of his failure and thence to acceptance of the Tleilaxu alternative.
"I am the smoke which banishes sleep in the night," Scytale said, employing
a Fedaykin code phrase: I bear bad tidings.
Paul fought to maintain calmness. He felt naked, his soul abandoned in a
groping-time concealed from every vision. Powerful oracles hid this Face Dancer.
Only the edges of these moments were known to Paul. He knew only what he could
not do. He could not slay this Face Dancer. That would precipitate the future
which must be avoided at all cost. Somehow, a way must be found to reach into
the darkness and change the terrifying pattern.
"Give me your message," Paul said.
Bannerjee moved to place himself where he could watch the girl's face. She
seemed to notice him for the First time and her gaze went to the knife handle
beneath the Security Officer's hand.
"The innocent do not believe in evil," she said, looking squarely at
Bannerjee.
Ahhh, well done, Paul thought. It was what the real Lichna would've said. He
felt a momentary pang for the real daughter of Otheym -- dead now, a corpse in
the sand. There was no time for such emotions, though. He scowled.
Bannerjee kept his attention on the girl.
"I was told to deliver my message in secret," she said.
"Why?" Bannerjee demanded, voice harsh, probing.
"Because it is my father's wish."
"This is my friend," Paul said. "Am I not a Fremen? Then my friend may hear
anything I hear."
Scytale composed the girl-shape. Was this a true Fremen custom . . . or was
it a test?
"The Emperor may make his own rules," Scytale said. "This is the message: My
father wishes you to come to him, bringing Chani."
"Why must I bring Chani?"
"She is your woman and a Sayyadina. This is a Water matter, by the rules of
our tribes. She must attest it that my father speaks according to the Fremen
Way."
There truly are Fremen in the conspiracy, Paul thought. This moment fitted
the shape of things to come for sure. And he had no alternative but to commit
himself to this course.
"Of what will your father speak?" Paul asked.
"He will speak of a plot against you -- a plot among the Fremen."
"Why doesn't he bring that message in person?" Bannerjee demanded.
She kept her gaze on Paul. "My father cannot come here. The plotters suspect
him. He'd not survive the journey."
"Could he not divulge the plot to you?" Bannerjee asked. "How came he to
risk his daughter on such a mission?"
"The details are locked in a distrans carrier that only Muad'dib may open,"
she said. "This much I know."
"Why not send the distrans, then?" Paul asked.
"It is a human distrans," she said.
"I'll go, then," Paul said. "But I'll go alone."
"Chani must come with you!"
"Chani is with child."
"When has a Fremen woman refused to . . ."
"My enemies fed her a subtle poison," Paul said. "It will be a difficult
birth. Her health will not permit her to accompany me now."
Before Scytale could still them, strange emotions passed over the girlfeatures: frustration, anger. Scytale was reminded that every victim must have a
way of escape -- even such a one as Muad'dib. The conspiracy had not failed,
though. This Atreides remained in the net. He was a creature who had developed
firmly into one pattern. He'd destroy himself before changing into the opposite
of that pattern. That had been the way with the Tleilaxu kwisatz haderach. It'd
be the way with this one. And then . . . the ghola.
"Let me ask Chani to decide this," she said.
"I have decided it," Paul said. "You will accompany me in Chani's stead."
"It requires a Sayyadina of the Rite!"
"Are you not Chani's friend?"
Boxed! Scytale thought. Does he suspect? No. He's being Fremen-cautious. And
the contraceptive is a fact. Well -- there are other ways.
"My father told me I was not to return," Scytale said, "that I was to seek
asylum with you. He said you'd not risk me."
Paul nodded. It was beautifully in character. He couldn't deny this asylum.
She'd plead Fremen obedience to a father's command.
"I'll take Stilgar's wife, Harah," Paul said. "You'll tell us the way to
your father."
"How do you know you can trust Stilgar's wife?"
"I know it."
"But I don't."
Paul pursed his lips, then: "Does your mother live?"
"My true mother has gone to Shai-hulud. My second mother still lives and
cares for my father. Why?"
"She's of Sietch Tabr?"
"Yes."
"I remember her," Paul said. "She will serve in Chani's place." He motioned
to Bannerjee. "Have attendants take Otheym's Lichna to suitable quarters."
Bannerjee nodded. Attendants. The key word meant that this messenger must be
put under special guard. He took her arm. She resisted.
"How will you go to my father?" she pleaded.
"You'll describe the way to Bannerjee," Paul said. "He is my friend."
"No! My father has commanded it! I cannot!"
"Bannerjee?" Paul said.
Bannerjee paused. Paul saw the man searching that encyclopedic memory which
had helped bring him to his position of trust. "I know a guide who can take you
to Otheym," Bannerjee said.
"Then I'll go alone," Paul said.
"Sire, if you . . . "
"Otheym wants it this way," Paul said, barely concealing the irony which
consumed him.
"Sire, it's too dangerous," Bannerjee protested.
"Even an Emperor must accept some risks," Paul said. "The decision is made.
Do as I've commanded."
Reluctantly, Bannerjee led the Face Dancer from the room.
Paul turned toward the blank screen behind his desk. He felt that he waited
for the arrival of a rock on its blind journey from some height.
Should he tell Bannerjee about the messenger's true nature? he wondered. No!
Such an incident hadn't been written on the screen of his vision. Any deviation
here carried precipitate violence. A moment of fulcrum had to be found, a place
where he could will himself out of the vision.
If such a moment existed . . .

No matter how exotic human civilization becomes, no matter the developments of
life and society nor the complexity of the machine / human interface, there
always come interludes of lonely power when the course of humankind, the very
future of humankind, depends upon the relatively simple actions of single
individuals.
-from The Tlielaxu Godbuk
As he crossed over on the high footbridge from his Keep to the Qizarate
Office Building, Paul added a limp to his walk. It was almost sunset and he
walked through long shadows that helped conceal him, but sharp eyes still might
detect something in his carriage that identified him. He wore a shield, but it
was not activated, his aides having decided that the shimmer of it might arouse
suspicions.
Paul glanced left. Strings of sandclouds lay across the sunset like slatted
shutters. The air was hiereg dry through his stillsuit filters.
He wasn't really alone out here, but the web of Security hadn't been this
loose around him since he'd ceased walking the streets alone in the night.
Ornithopters with night scanners drifted far overhead in seemingly random
pattern, all of them tied to his movements through a transmitter concealed in
his clothing. Picked men walked the streets below. Others had fanned out through
the city after seeing the Emperor in his disguise -- Fremen costume down to the
stillsuit and temag desert boots, the darkened features. His cheeks had been
distorted with plastene inserts. A catchtube ran down along his left jaw.
As he reached the opposite end of the bridge, Paul glanced back, noted a
movement beside the stone lattice that concealed a balcony of his private
quarters. Chani, no doubt. "Hunting for sand in the desert," she'd called this
venture.
How little she understood the bitter choice. Selecting among agonies, he
thought, made even lesser agonies near unbearable.
For a blurred, emotionally painful moment, he relived their parting. At the
last instant, Chani had experienced a tau-glimpse of his feelings, but she had
misinterpreted. She had thought his emotions were those experienced in the
parting of loved ones when one entered the dangerous unknown.
Would that I did not know, he thought.
He had crossed the bridge now and entered the upper passageway through the
office building. There were fixed glowglobes here and people hurrying on
business. The Qizarate never slept. Paul found his attention caught by the signs
above doorways, as though he were seeing them for the first time: Speed
Merchants. Wind Stills and Retorts. Prophetic Prospects. Tests of Faith.
Religious Supply. Weaponry . . . Propagation of the Faith . . .
A more honest label would've been Propagation of the Bureaucracy, he
thought.
A type of religious civil servant had sprung up all through his universe.
This new man of the Qizarate was more often a convert. He seldom displaced a
Freman in the key posts, but he was filling all the interstices. He used melange
as much to show he could afford it as for the geriatric benefits. He stood apart
from his rulers -- Emperor, Guild, Bene Gesserit, Landsraad, Family or Qizarate.
His gods were Routine and Records. He was served by mentats and prodigious
filing systems. Expediency was the first word in his catechism, although he gave
proper lip-service to the precepts of the Butlerians. Machines could not be
fashioned in the image of a man's mind, he said, but he betrayed by every action
that he preferred machines to men, statistics to individuals, the faraway
general view to the intimate personal touch requiring imagination and
initiative.
As Paul emerged onto the ramp at the far side of the building, he heard the
bells calling the Evening Rite at Alia's Fane.
There was an odd feeling of permanence about the bells.
The temple across the thronged square was new, its rituals of recent
devising, but there was something about this setting in a desert sink at the
edge of Arrakeen -- something in the way wind-driven sand had begun to weather
stones and plastene, something in the haphazard way buildings had gone up around
the Fane. Everything conspired to produce the impression that this was a very
old place full of traditions and mystery.
He was down into the press of people now -- committed. The only guide his
Security force could find had insisted it be done this way. Security hadn't
liked Paul's ready agreement. Stilgar had liked it even less. And Chani had
objected most of all.
The crowd around him, even while its members brushed against him, glanced
his way unseeing and passed on, gave him a curious freedom of movement. It was
the way they'd been conditioned to treat a Fremen, he knew. He carried himself
like a man of the inner desert. Such men were quick to anger.
As he moved into the quickening flow to the temple steps, the crush of
people became even greater. Those all around could not help but press against
him now, but he found himself the target for ritual apologies: "Your pardon,
noble sir. I cannot prevent this discourtesy." "Pardon, sir; this crush of
people is the worst I've ever seen." "I abase myself, holy citizen. A lout
shoved me."
Paul ignored the words after the first few. There was no feeling in them
except a kind of ritual fear. He found himself, instead, thinking that he had
come a long way from his boyhood days in Caladan Castle. Where had he put his
foot on the path that led to this journey across a crowded square on a planet so
far from Caladan? Had he really put his foot on a path? He could not say he had
acted at any point in his life for one specific reason. The motives and
impinging forces had been complex -- more complex possibly than any other set of
goads in human history. He had the heady feeling here that he might still avoid
the fate he could see so clearly along this path. But the crowd pushed him
forward and he experienced the dizzy sense that he had lost his way, lost
personal direction over his life.
The crowd flowed with him up the steps now into the temple portico. Voices
grew hushed. The smell of fear grew stronger -- acrid, sweaty.
Acolytes had already begun the service within the temple. Their plain chant
dominated the other sounds -- whispers, rustle of garments, shuffling feet,
coughs -- telling the story of the Far Places visited by the Priestess in her
holy trance.
"She rides the sandworm of space!
She guides through all storms
Into the land of gentle winds.
Though we sleep by the snake's den,
She guards our dreaming souls.
Shunning the desert heat,
She hides us in a cool hollow.
The gleaming of her white teeth
Guides us in the night.
By the braids of her hair
We are lifted up to heaven!
Sweet fragrance, flower-scented.
Surrounds us in her presence."
Balak! Paul thought, thinking in Fremen. Look out! She can be filled with
angry passion, too.
The temple portico was lined with tall, slender glow-tubes simulating candle
flame. They flickered. The flickering stirred ancestral memories in Paul even
while he knew that was the intent. This setting was an atavism, subtly
contrived, effective. He hated his own hand in it.
The crowd flowed with him through tall metal doors into the gigantic nave, a
gloomy place with the flickering lights far away overhead, a brilliantly
illuminated altar at the far end. Behind the altar, a deceptively simple affair
of black wood encrusted with sand patterns from the Fremen mythology, hidden
lights played on the field of a pru-door to create a rainbow borealis. The seven
rows of chanting acolytes ranked below that spectral curtain took on an eerie
quality: black robes, white faces, mouths moving in unison.
Paul studied the pilgrims around him, suddenly envious of their intentness,
their air of listening to truths he could not hear. It seemed to him that they
gained something here which was denied to him, something mysteriously healing.
He tried to inch his way closer to the altar, was stopped by a hand on his
arm. Paul whipped his gaze around, met the probing stare of an ancient Fremen -blue-blue eyes beneath overhanging brows, recognition in them. A name flashed
into Paul's mind: Rasir, a companion from the sietch days.
In the press of the crowd, Paul knew he was completely vulnerable if Rasir
planned violence.
The old man pressed close, one hand beneath a sand-grimed robe -- grasping
the hilt of a crysknife, no doubt. Paul set himself as best he could to resist
attack. The old man moved his head toward Paul's ear, whispered: "We will go
with the others."
It was the signal to identify his guide. Paul nodded.
Rasir drew back, faced the altar.
"She comes from the east," the acolytes chanted. "The sun stands at her
back. All things are exposed. In the full glare of light -- her eyes miss no
thing, neither light nor dark."
A wailing rebaba jarred across the voices, stilled them, receded into
silence. With an electric abruptness, the crowd surged forward several meters.
They were packed into a tight mass of flesh now, the air heavy with their
breathing and the scent of spice.
"Shai-hulud writes on clean sand!" the acolytes shouted.
Paul felt his own breath catch in unison with those around him. A feminine
chorus began singing faintly from the shadows behind the shimmering pru-door:
"Alia . . . Alia . . . Alia . . . " It grew louder and louder, fell to a sudden
silence.
Again -- voices beginning vesper-soft:
"She stills all storms -Her eyes kill our enemies,
And torment the unbelievers.
From the spires of Tuono
Where dawnlight strikes
And clear water runs,
You see her shadow.
In the shining summer heat
She serves us bread and milk --
Cool, fragrant with spices.
Her eyes melt our enemies,
Torment our oppressors
And pierce all mysteries.
She is Alia . . . Alia . . . Alia . . . "
Slowly, the voices trailed off.
Paul felt sickened. What are we doing? he asked himself. Alia was a child
witch, but she was growing older. And he thought: Growing older is to grow more
wicked.
The collective mental atmosphere of the temple ate at his psyche. He could
sense that element of himself which was one with those all around him, but the
differences formed a deadly contradiction. He stood immersed, isolated in a
personal sin which he could never expiate. The immensity of the universe outside
the temple flooded his awareness. How could one man, one ritual, hope to knit
such immensity into a garment fitted to all men?
Paul shuddered.
The universe opposed him at every step. It eluded his grasp, conceived
countless disguises to delude him. That universe would never agree with any
shape he gave it.
A profound hush spread through the temple.
Alia emerged from the darkness behind the shimmering rainbows. She wore a
yellow robe trimmed in Atreides green -- yellow for sunlight, green for the
death which produced life. Paul experienced the sudden surprising thought that
Alia had emerged here just for him, for him alone. He stared across the mob in
the temple at his sister. She was his sister. He knew her ritual and its roots,
but he had never before stood out here with the pilgrims, watched her through
their eyes. Here, performing the mystery of this place, he saw that she partook
of the universe which opposed him.
Acolytes brought her a golden chalice.
Alia raised the chalice.
With part of his awareness, Paul knew that the chalice contained the
unaltered melange, the subtle poison, her sacrament of the oracle.
Her gaze on the chalice, Alia spoke. Her voice caressed the ears, flower
sound, flowing and musical:
"In the beginning, we were empty," she said.
"Ignorant of all things," the chorus sang.
"We did not know the Power that abides in every place," Alia said.
"And in every Time " the chorus sang.
"Here is the Power," Alia said, raising the chalice slightly.
"It brings us joy," sang the chorus.
And it brings us distress, Paul thought.
"It awakens the soul," Alia said.
"It dispels all doubts," the chorus sang.
"In worlds, we perish," Alia said.
"In the Power, we survive," sang the chorus.
Alia put the chalice to her lips, drank.
To his astonishment, Paul found he was holding his breath like the meanest
pilgrim of this mob. Despite every shred of personal knowledge about the
experience Alia was undergoing, he had been caught in the tao-web. He felt
himself remembering how that fiery poison coursed into the body. Memory unfolded
the time-stopping when awareness became a mote which changed the poison. He
reexperienced the awakening into timelessness where all things were possible. He
knew Alia's present experience, yet he saw now that he did not know it. Mystery
blinded the eyes.
Alia trembled, sank to her knees.

Paul exhaled with the enraptured pilgrims. He nodded. Part of the veil began
to lift from him. Absorbed in the bliss of a vision, he had forgotten that each
vision belonged to all those who were still on-the-way, still to become. In the
vision, one passed through a darkness, unable to distinguish reality from
insubstantial accident. One hungered for absolutes which could never be.
Hungering, one lost the present.
Alia swayed with the rapture of spice change.
Paul felt that some transcendental presence spoke to him, saying: "Look! See
there! See what you've ignored?" In that instant, he thought he looked through
other eyes, that he saw an imagery and rhythm in this place which no artist or
poet could reproduce. It was vital and beautiful, a glaring light that exposed
all power-gluttony . . . even his own.
Alia spoke. Her amplified voice boomed across the nave.
"Luminous night," she cried.
A moan swept like a wave through the crush of pilgrims.
"Nothing hides in such a night!" Alia said. "What rare light is this
darkness? You cannot fix your gaze upon it! Senses cannot record it. No words
describe it." Her voice lowered. "The abyss remains. It is pregnant with all the
things yet to be. Ahhhhh, what gentle violence!"
Paul felt that he waited for some private signal from his sister. It could
be any action or word, something of wizardry and mystical processes, an outward
streaming that would fit him like an arrow into a cosmic bow. This instant lay
like quivering mercury in his awareness.
"There will be sadness," Alia intoned. "I remind you that all things are but
a beginning, forever beginning. Worlds wait to be conquered. Some within the
sound of my voice will attain exalted destinies. You will sneer at the past,
forgetting what I tell you now: within all differences there is unity."
Paul suppressed a cry of disappointment as Alia lowered her head. She had
not said the thing he waited to hear. His body felt like a dry shell, a husk
abandoned by some desert insect.
Others must feel something similar, he thought. He sensed the restlessness
about him. Abruptly, a woman in the mob, someone far down in the nave to Paul's
left, cried out, a wordless noise of anguish.
Alia lifted her head and Paul had the giddy sensation that the distance
between them collapsed, that he stared directly into her glazed eyes -- only
inches away from her.
"Who summons me?" Alia asked.
"I do," the woman cried. "I do, Alia. Oh, Alia, help me. They say my son was
killed on Muritan. Is he gone? Will I never see my son again . . . never?"
"You try to walk backward in the sand," Alia intoned. "Nothing is lost.
Everything returns later, but you may not recognize the changed form that
returns."
"Alia, I don't understand!" the woman wailed.
"You live in the air but you do not see it," Alia said, sharpness in her
voice. "Are you a lizard? Your voice has the Fremen accent. Does a Fremen try to
bring back the dead? What do we need from our dead except their water?"
Down in the center of the nave, a man in a rich red cloak lifted both hands,
the sleeves falling to expose white-clad arms. "Alia," he shouted, "I have had a
business proposal. Should I accept?"
"You come here like a beggar," Alia said. "You look for the golden bowl but
you will find only a dagger."
"I have been asked to kill a man!" a voice shouted from off to the right -a deep voice with sietch tones. "Should I accept? Accepting, would I succeed?"
"Beginning and end are a single thing," Alia snapped. "Have I not told you
this before? You didn't come here to ask that question. What is it you cannot
believe that you must come here and cry out against it?"
"She's in a fierce mood tonight," a woman near Paul muttered. "Have you ever
seen her this angry?"
She knows I'm out here, Paul thought. Did she see something in the vision
that angered her? Is she raging at me?
"Alia," a man directly in front of Paul called. "Tell these businessmen and
faint-hearts how long your brother will rule!"
"I permit you to look around that corner by yourself," Alia snarled. "You
carry your prejudice in your mouth! It is because my brother rides the worm of
chaos that you have roof and water!"
With a fierce gesture, clutching her robe, Alia whirled away, strode through
the shimmering ribbons of light, was lost in the darkness behind.
Immediately, the acolytes took up the closing chant, but their rhythm was
off. Obviously, they'd been caught by the unexpected ending of the rite. An
incoherent mumbling arose on all sides of the crowd. Paul felt the stirring
around him -- restless, dissatisfied.
"It was that fool with his stupid question about business," a woman near
Paul muttered. "The hypocrite!"
What had Alia seen? What track through the future?
Something had happened here tonight, souring the rite of the oracle.
Usually, the crowd clamored for Alia to answer their pitiful questions. They
came as beggars to the oracle, yes. He had heard them thus many times as he'd
watched, hidden in the darkness behind the altar. What had been different about
this night?
The old Fremen tugged Paul's sleeve, nodded toward the exit. The crowd
already was beginning to push in that direction. Paul allowed himself to be
pressed along with them, the guide's hand upon his sleeve. There was the feeling
in him then that his body had become the manifestation of some power he could no
longer control. He had become a non-being, a stillness which moved itself. At
the core of the non-being, there he existed, allowing himself to be led through
the streets of his city, following a track so familiar to his visions that it
froze his heart with grief,
I should know what Alia saw, bethought, I have seen it enough times myself.
And she didn't cry out against it . . . she saw the alternatives, too.

Production growth and income growth must not get out of step in my Empire. That
is the substance of my command. There are to be no balance-of-payment
difficulties between the different spheres of influence. And the reason for this
is simply because I command it. I want to emphasize my authority in this area. I
am the supreme energy-eater of this domain, and will remain so, alive or dead.
My Government is the economy.
-Order in Council The Emperor Paul Muad'dib
"I will leave you here," the old man said, taking his hand from Paul's
sleeve. "It is on the right, second door from the far end. Go with Shai-hulud,
Muad'dib . . . and remember when you were Usul."
Paul's guide slipped away into the darkness.
There would be Security men somewhere out there waiting to grab the guide
and take the man to a place of questioning, Paul knew. But Paul found himself
hoping the old Fremen would escape.
There were stars overhead and the distant light of First Moon somewhere
beyond the Shield Wall. But this place was not the open desert where a man could
sight on a star to guide his course. The old man had brought him into one of the
new suburbs; this much Paul recognized.

This street now was thick with sand blown in from encroaching dunes. A dim
light glowed from a single public suspensor globe far down the street. It gave
enough illumination to show that this was a dead-end street.
The air around him was thick with the smell of a reclamation still. The
thing must be poorly capped for its fetid odors to escape, loosing a dangerously
wasteful amount of moisture into the night air. How careless his people had
grown, Paul thought. They were millionaires of water -- forgetful of the days
when a man on Arrakis could have been killed for just an eighth share of the
water in his body.
Why am I hesitating? Paul wondered. It is the second door from the far end.
I knew that without being told. But this thing must be played out with
precision. So . . . I hesitate.
The noise of an argument arose suddenly from the corner house on Paul's
left. A woman there berated someone: the new wing of their house leaked dust,
she complained. Did he think water fell from heaven? If dust came in, moisture
got out.
Some remember, Paul thought.
He moved down the street and the quarrel faded away behind.
Water from heaven! he thought.
Some Fremen had seen that wonder on other worlds. He had seen it himself,
had ordered it for Arrakis, but the memory of it felt like something that had
occurred to another person. Rain, it was called. Abruptly, he recalled a
rainstorm on his birthworld -- clouds thick and gray in the sky of Caladan, an
electric storm presence, moist air, the big wet drops drumming on skylights. It
ran in rivulets off the eaves. Storm drains took the water away to a river which
ran muddy and turgid past the Family orchards . . . trees there with their
barren branches glistening wetly.
Paul's foot caught in a low drift of sand across the street. For an instant,
he felt mud clinging to the shoes of his childhood. Then he was back in the
sand, in the dust-clotted, wind-muffled darkness with the Future hanging over
him, taunting. He could feel the aridity of life around him like an accusation.
You did this! They'd become a civilization of dry-eyed watchers and taletellers,
people who solved all problems with power . . . and more power . . . and still
more power -- hating every erg of it.
Rough stones came underfoot. His vision remembered them. The dark rectangle
of a doorway appeared on his right -- black in black: Otheym's house. Fate's
house, a place different from the ones around it only in the role Time had
chosen for it. It was a strange place to be marked down in history.
The door opened to his knock. The gap revealed the dull green light of an
atrium. A dwarf peered out, ancient face on a child's body, an apparition
prescience had never seen.
"You've come then," the apparition said. The dwarf stepped aside, no awe in
his manner, merely the gloating of a slow smile. "Come in! Come in!"
Paul hesitated. There'd been no dwarf in the vision, but all else remained
identical. Visions could contain such disparities and still hold true to their
original plunge into infinity. But the difference dared him to hope. He glanced
back up the street at the creamy pearl glistening of his moon swimming out of
jagged shadows. The moon haunted him. How did it fall?
"Come in," the dwarf insisted.
Paul entered, heard the door thud into its moisture seals behind. The dwarf
passed him, led the way, enormous feet slapping the floor, opened the delicate
lattice gate into the roofed central courtyard, gestured. "They await, Sire."
Sire, Paul thought. He knows me, then.
Before Paul could explore this discovery, the dwarf slipped away down a side
passage. Hope was a dervish wind whirling, dancing in Paul. He headed across the
courtyard. It was a dark and gloomy place, the smell of sickness and defeat in
it. He felt daunted by the atmosphere. Was it defeat to choose a lesser evil? he
wondered. How far down this track had he come?
Light poured from a narrow doorway in the far wall. He put down the feeling
of watchers and evil smells, entered the doorway into a small room. It was a
barren place by Fremen standards with heireg hangings on only two walls.
Opposite the door, a man sat on carmine cushions beneath the best hanging. A
feminine figure hovered in shadows behind another doorway in a barren wall to
the left.
Paul felt vision-trapped. This was the way it'd gone. Where was the dwarf?
Where was the difference?
His senses absorbed the room in a single gestalten sweep. The place had
received painstaking care despite its poor furnishings. Hooks and rods across
the barren walls showed where hangings had been removed. Pilgrims paid enormous
prices for authentic Fremen artifacts, Paul reminded himself. Rich pilgrims
counted desert tapestries as treasures, true marks of a hajj.
Paul felt that the barren walls accused him with their fresh gypsum wash.
The threadbare condition of the two remaining hangings amplified the sense of
guilt.
A narrow shelf occupied the wall on his right. It held a row of portraits -mostly bearded Fremen, some in still-suits with their catchtubes dangling, some
in Imperial uniforms posed against exotic offworld backgrounds. The most common
scene was a seascape.
The Fremen on cushions cleared his throat, forcing Paul to look at him. It
was Otheym precisely as the vision had revealed him: neck grown scrawny, a bird
thing which appeared too weak to support the large head. The face was a lopsided
ruin -- networks of crisscrossed scars on the left cheek below a drooping, wet
eye, but clear skin on the other side and a straight, blue-in-blue Fremen gaze.
A long kedge of a nose bisected the face.
Otheym's cushion sat in the center of a threadbare rug, brown with maroon
and gold threads. The cushion fabric betrayed splotches of wear and patching,
but every bit of metal around the seated figure shone from polishing -- the
portrait frames, shelf lip and brackets, the pedestal of a low table on the
right.
Paul nodded to the clear half of Otheym's face, said: "Good luck to you and
your dwelling place." It was the greeting of an old friend and sietch mate.
"So I see you once more, Usul."
The voice speaking his tribal name whined with an old man's quavering. The
dull drooping eye on the ruined side of the face moved above the parchment skin
and scars. Gray bristles stubbled that side and the jawline there hung with
scabrous peelings. Otheym's mouth twisted as he spoke, the gap exposing silvery
metal teeth.
"Muad'dib always answers the call of a Fedaykin," Paul said.
The woman in the doorway shadows moved, said: "So Stilgar boasts."
She came forward into the light, an older version of the Lichna which the
Face Dancer had copied. Paul recalled then that Otheym had married sisters. Her
hair was gray, nose grown witch-sharp. Weavers' calluses ran along her
forefingers and thumbs. A Fremen woman would've displayed such marks proudly in
the sietch days, but she saw his attention on her hands, hid them under a fold
of her pale blue robe.
Paul remembered her name then -- Dhuri. The shock was he remembered her as a
child, not as she'd been in his vision of these moments. It was the whine that
edged her voice, Paul told himself. She'd whined even as a child.
"You see me here," Paul said. "Would I be here if Stilgar hadn't approved?"
He turned toward Otheym. "I carry your water burden, Otheym. Command me."
This was the straight Fremen talk of sietch brothers.
Otheym produced a shaky nod, almost too much for that thin neck. He lifted a
liver-marked left hand, pointed to the ruin of his face. "I caught the splitting
disease on Tarahell, Usul," he wheezed. "Right after the victory when we'd all .
. ." A fit of coughing stopped his voice.
"The tribe will collect his water soon," Dhuri said. She crossed to Otheym,
propped pillows behind him, held his shoulder to steady him until the coughing
passed. She wasn't really very old, Paul saw, but a look of lost hopes ringed
her mouth, bitterness lay in her eyes.
"I'll summon doctors," Paul said.
Dhuri turned, hand on hip. "We've had medical men, as good as any you could
summon." She sent an involuntary glance to the barren wall on her left.
And the medical men were costly, Paul thought.
He felt edgy, constrained by the vision but aware that minor differences had
crept in. How could he exploit the differences? Time came out of its skein with
subtle changes, but the background fabric held oppressive sameness. He knew with
terrifying certainty that if he tried to break out of the enclosing pattern
here, it'd become a thing of terrible violence. The power in this deceptively
gentle flow of Time oppressed him.
"Say what you want of me," he growled.
"Couldn't it be that Otheym needed a friend to stand by him in this time?"
Dhuri asked. "Does a Fedaykin have to consign his flesh to strangers?"
We shared Sietch Tabr, Paul reminded himself. She has the right to berate me
for apparent callousness.
"What I can do I will do," Paul said.
Another fit of coughing shook Otheym. When it had passed, he gasped:
"There's treachery, Usul. Fremen plot against you." His mouth worked then
without sound. Spittle escaped his lips. Dhuri wiped his mouth with a corner of
her robe, and Paul saw how her face betrayed anger at such waste of moisture.
Frustrated rage threatened to overwhelm Paul then. That Otheym should be
spent thus! A Fedaykin deserved better. But no choice remained -- not for a
Death Commando or his Emperor. They walked Occam's razor in this room. The
slightest misstep multiplied horrors -- not just for themselves, but for all
humankind, even for those who would destroy them.
Paul squeezed calmness into his mind, looked at Dhuri. The expression of
terrible longing with which she gazed at Otheym strengthened Paul. Chani must
never look at me that way, he told himself.
"Lichna spoke of a message," Paul said.
"My dwarf," Otheym wheezed. "I bought him on . . . on . . . on a world . . .
I forget. He's a human distrans, a toy discarded by the Tleilaxu. He's recorded
all the names . . . the traitors . . ."
Otheym fell silent, trembling.
"You speak of Lichna," Dhuri said. "When you arrived, we knew she'd reached
you safely. If you're thinking of this new burden Otheym places upon you, Lichna
is the sum of that burden. An even exchange, Usul: take the dwarf and go."
Paul suppressed a shudder, closed his eyes. Lichna! The real daughter had
perished in the desert, a semuta-wracked body abandoned to the sand and the
wind.
Opening his eyes, Paul said: "You could've come to me at any time for . . ."
"Otheym stayed away that he might be numbered among those who hate you,
Usul," Dhuri said. "The house to the south of us at the end of the street, that
is a gathering place for your foes. It's why we took this hovel."
"Then summon the dwarf and we'll leave," Paul said.
"You've not listened well," Dhuri said.
"You must take the dwarf to a safe place," Otheym said, an odd strength in
his voice. "He carries the only record of the traitors. No one suspects his
talent. They think I keep him for amusement."
"We cannot leave," Dhuri said. "Only you and the dwarf. It's known . . . how
poor we are. We've said we're selling the dwarf. They'll take you for the buyer.
It's your only chance."
Paul consulted his memory of the vision: in it, he'd left here with the
names of the traitors, but never seeing how those names were carried. The dwarf
obviously moved under the protection of another oracle. It occurred to Paul then
that all creatures must carry some kind of destiny stamped out by purposes of
varying strengths, by the fixation of training and disposition. From the moment
the Jihad had chosen him, he'd felt himself hemmed in by the forces of a
multitude. Their fixed purposes demanded and controlled his course. Any
delusions of Free Will he harbored now must be merely the prisoner rattling his
cage. His curse lay in the fact that he saw the cage. He saw it!
He listened now to the emptiness of this house: only the four of them in it
-- Dhuri, Otheym, the dwarf and himself. He inhaled the fear and tension of his
companions, sensed the watchers -- his own force hovering in 'thopters far
overhead . . . and those others . . . next door.
I was wrong to hope, Paul thought. But thinking of hope brought him a
twisted sense of hope, and he felt that he might yet seize his moment.
"Summon the dwarf," he said.
"Bijaz!" Dhuri called.
"You call me?" The dwarf stepped into the room from the courtyard, an alert
expression of worry on his face.
"You have a new master, Bijaz," Dhuri said. She stared at Paul. "You may
call him . . . Usul."
"Usul, that's the base of the pillar," Bijaz said, translating. "How can
Usul be base when I'm the basest thing living?"
"He always speaks thus," Otheym apologized.
"I don't speak," Bijaz said. "I operate a machine called language. It creaks
and groans, but is mine own."
A Tleilaxu toy, learned and alert, Paul thought. The Bene Tleilax never
threw away something this valuable. He turned, studied the dwarf. Round melange
eyes returned his stare.
"What other talents have you, Bijaz?" Paul asked.
"I know when we should leave," Bijaz said. "It's a talent few men have.
There's a time for endings -- and that's a good beginning. Let us begin to go,
Usul."
Paul examined his vision memory: no dwarf, but the little man's words fitted
the occasion.
"At the door, you called me Sire," Paul said. "You know me, then?"
"You've sired, Sire," Bijaz said, grinning. "You are much more than the base
Usul. You're the Atreides Emperor, Paul Muad'dib. And you are my finger." He
held up the index finger of his right hand.
"Bijaz!" Dhuri snapped. "You tempt fate."
"I tempt my finger," Bijaz protested, voice squeaking. He pointed at Usul.
"I point at Usul. Is my finger not Usul himself? Or is it a reflection of
something more base?" He brought the finger close to his eyes, examined it with
a mocking grin, first one side then the other. "Ahhh, it's merely a finger,
after all."
"He often rattles on thus," Dhuri said, worry in her voice. "I think it's
why he was discarded by the Tleilaxu."
"I'll not be patronized," Bijaz said, "yet I have a new patron. How strange
the workings of the finger." He peered at Dhuri and Otheym, eyes oddly bright.
"A weak glue bound us, Otheym. A few tears and we part." The dwarfs big feet
rasped on the floor as he whirled completely around, stopped facing Paul. "Ahhh,
patron! I came the long way around to find you."
Paul nodded.
"You'll be kind, Usul?" Bijaz asked. "I'm a person, you know. Persons come
in many shapes and sizes. This be but one of them. I'm weak of muscle, but
strong of mouth; cheap to feed, but costly to fill. Empty me as you will,
there's still more in me than men put there."
"We've no time for your stupid riddles," Dhuri growled. "You should be
gone."
"I'm riddled with conundrums," Bijaz said, "but not all of them stupid. To
be gone, Usul, is to be a bygone. Yes? Let us let bygones be bygones. Dhuri
speaks truth, and I've the talent for hearing that, too."
"You've truthsense?" Paul asked, determined now to wait out the clockwork of
his vision. Anything was better than shattering these moments and producing the
new consequences. There remained things for Otheym to say lest Time be diverted
into even more horrifying channels.
"I've now-sense" Bijaz said.
Paul noted that the dwarf had grown more nervous. Was the little man aware
of things about to happen? Could Bijaz be his own oracle?
"Did you inquire of Lichna?" Otheym asked suddenly, peering up at Dhuri with
his one good eye.
"Lichna is safe," Dhuri said.
Paul lowered his head, lest his expression betray the lie. Safe! Lichna was
ashes in a secret grave.
"That's good then," Otheym said, taking Paul's lowered head for a nod of
agreement. "One good thing among the evils, Usul. I don't like the world we're
making, you know that? It was better when we were alone in the desert with only
the Harkonnens for enemy."
"There's but a thin line between many an enemy and many a friend," Bijaz
said. "Where that line stops, there's no beginning and no end. Let's end it, my
friends." He moved to Paul's side, jittered from one foot to the other.
"What's now-sense?" Paul asked, dragging out these moments, goading the
dwarf.
"Now!" Bijaz said, trembling. "Now! Now!" He tugged at Paul's robe. "Let us
go now!"
"His mouth rattles, but there's no harm in him," Otheym said, affection in
his voice, the one good eye staring at Bijaz.
"Even a rattle can signal departure," Bijaz said. "And so can tears. Let's
be gone while there's time to begin."
"Bijaz, what do you fear?" Paul asked.
"I fear the spirit seeking me now," Bijaz muttered. Perspiration stood out
on his forehead. His cheeks twitched. "I fear the one who thinks not and will
have no body except mine -- and that one gone back into itself! I fear the
things I see and the things I do not see."
This dwarf does possess the power of prescience, Paul thought. Bijaz shared
the terrifying oracle. Did he share the oracle's fate, as well? How potent was
the dwarf's power? Did he have the little prescience of those who dabbled in the
Dune Tarot? Or was it something greater? How much had he seen?
"Best you go," Dhuri said. "Bijaz is right."
"Every minute we linger," Bijaz said, "prolongs . . . prolongs the present!"
Every minute I linger defers my guilt, Paul thought. A worm's poisonous
breath, its teeth dripping dust, had washed over him. It had happened long ago,
but he inhaled the memory of it now -- spice and bitterness. He could sense his
own worm waiting -- "the urn of the desert."
"These are troubled times," he said, addressing himself to Otheym's judgment
of their world.
"Fremen know what to do in time of trouble," Dhuri said.
Otheym contributed a shaky nod.
Paul glanced at Dhuri. He'd not expected gratitude, would have been burdened
by it more than he could bear, but Otheym's bitterness and the passionate
resentment he saw in Dhuri's eyes shook his resolve. Was anything worth this
price?
"Delay serves no purpose," Dhuri said.
"Do what you must, Usul." Otheym wheezed.

Paul sighed. The words of the vision had been spoken. "There'll be an
accounting," he said, to complete it. Turning, he strode from the room, heard
Bijaz foot-slapping behind.
"Bygones, bygones," Bijaz muttered as they went. "Let bygones fall where
they may. This has been a dirty day."

The convoluted wording of legalisms grew up around the necessity to hide from
ourselves the violence we intend toward each other. Between depriving a man of
one hour from his life and depriving him of his life there exists only a
difference of degree. You have done violence to him, consumed his energy.
Elaborate euphemisms may conceal your intent to kill, but behind any use of
power over another the ultimate assumption remains: "I feed on your energy."
-Addenda to Orders in Council The Emperor Paul Muad'dib
First Moon stood high over the city as Paul, his shield activated and
shimmering around him, emerged from the cul-de-sac. A wind off the massif
whirled sand and dust down the narrow street, causing Bijaz to blink and shield
his eyes.
"We must hurry," the dwarf muttered. "Hurry! Hurry!"
"You sense danger?" Paul asked, probing.
"I know danger!"
An abrupt sense of peril very near was followed almost immediately by a
figure joining them out of a doorway.
Bijaz crouched and whimpered.
It was only Stilgar moving like a war machine, head thrust forward, feet
striking the street solidly.
Swiftly, Paul explained the value of the dwarf, handed Bijaz over to
Stilgar. The pace of the vision moved here with great rapidity. Stilgar sped
away with Bijaz. Security Guards enveloped Paul. Orders were given to send men
down the street toward the house beyond Otheym's. The men hurried to obey,
shadows among shadows.
More sacrifices, Paul thought.
"We want live prisoners," one of the guard officers hissed.
The sound was a vision-echo in Paul's ears. It went with solid precision
here -- vision/reality, tick for tick. Ornithopters drifted down across the
moon.
The night was full of Imperial troopers attacking.
A soft hiss grew out of the other sounds, climbed to a roar while they still
heard the sibilance. It picked up a terra-cotta glow that hid the stars,
engulfed the moon.
Paul, knowing that sound and glow from the earliest nightmare glimpses of
his vision, felt an odd sense of fulfillment. It went the way it must. "Stone
burner!" someone screamed.
"Stone burner!" The cry was all around him.
"Stone burner . . . stone burner . . ."
Because it was required of him, Paul threw a protective arm across his face,
dove for the low lip of a curb. It already was too late, of course.
Where Otheym's house had been there stood now a pillar of fire, a blinding
jet roaring at the heavens. It gave off a dirty brilliance which threw into
sharp relief every ballet movement of the fighting and fleeing men, the tipping
retreat of ornithopters.
For every member of this frantic throng it was too late.
The ground grew hot beneath Paul. He heard the sound of running stop. Men
threw themselves down all around him, every one of them aware that there was no
point in running. The first damage had been done; and now they must wait out the
extent of the stone burner's potency. The things's radiation, which no man could
outrun, already had penetrated their flesh. The peculiar result of stone-burner
radiation already was at work in them. What else this weapon might do now lay in
the planning of the men who had used it, the men who had defied the Great
Convention to use it.
"God's . . . a stone burner," someone whimpered. "I . . . don't . . . want .
. . to . . . be . . . blind."
"Who does?" The harsh voice of a trooper far down the street
"The Tleilaxu will sell many eyes here," someone near Paul growled. "Now,
shut up and wait!"
They waited.
Paul remained silent, thinking what this weapon implied. Too much fuel in it
and it'd cut its way into the planet's core. Dune's molten level lay deep, but
the more dangerous for that. Such pressures released and out of control might
split a planet, scattering lifeless bits and pieces through space.
"I think it's dying down a bit," someone said.
"It's just digging deeper," Paul cautioned. "Stay put, all of you. Stilgar
will be sending help."
"Stilgar got away?"
"Stilgar got away."
"The ground's hot," someone complained.
"They dared use atomics!" a trooper near Paul protested.
"The sound's diminishing," someone down the street said.
Paul ignored the words, concentrated on his fingertips against the street.
He could feel the rolling-rumbling of the thing -- deep . . . deep . . .
"My eyes!" someone cried. "I can't see!"
Someone closer to it than I was, Paul thought. He still could see to the end
of the cul-de-sac when he lifted his head, although there was a mistiness across
the scene. A red-yellow glow filled the area where Otheym's house and its
neighbor had been. Pieces of adjoining buildings made dark patterns as they
crumbled into the glowing pit.
Paul climbed to his feet. He felt the stone burner die, silence beneath him.
His body was wet with perspiration against the stillsuit's slickness -- too much
for the suit to accommodate. The air he drew into his lungs carried the heat and
sulfur stench of the burner.
As he looked at the troopers beginning to stand up around him, the mist on
Paul's eyes faded into darkness. He summoned up his oracular vision of these
moments, then, turned and strode along the track that Time had carved for him,
fitting himself into the vision so tightly that it could not escape. He felt
himself grow aware of this place as a multitudinous possession, reality welded
to prediction.
Moans and groans of his troopers arose all around him as the men realized
their blindness.
"Hold fast!" Paul shouted. "Help is coming!" And, as the complaints
persisted, he said: "This is Muad'dib! I command you to hold fast! Help comes!"
Silence.
Then, true to his vision, a nearby guardsman said: "Is it truly the Emperor?
Which of you can see? Tell me."
"None of us has eyes," Paul said. "They have taken my eyes, as well, but not
my vision. I can see you standing there, a dirty wall within touching distance
on your left. Now wait bravely. Stilgar comes with our friends."
The thwock-thwock of many 'thopters grew louder all around. There was the
sound of hurrying feet. Paul watched his friends come, matching their sounds to
his oracular vision.
"Stilgar!" Paul shouted, waving an arm. "Over here!"
"Thanks to Shai-hulud," Stilgar cried, running up to Paul. "You're not . . .
" In the sudden silence, Paul's vision showed him Stilgar staring with an
expression of agony at the ruined eyes of his friend and Emperor. "Oh, m' Lord,"
Stilgar groaned. "Usul . . . Usul . . . Usul . . . "
"What of the stone burner?" one of the newcomers shouted.
"It's ended," Paul said, raising his voice. He gestured. "Get up there now
and rescue the ones who were closest to it. Put up barriers. Lively now!" He
turned back to Stilgar.
"Do you see, m'Lord?" Stilgar asked, wonder in his tone. "How can you see?"
For answer, Paul put a finger out to touch Stilgar's cheek above the
stillsuit mouthcap, felt tears. "You need give no moisture to me, old friend,"
Paul said. "I am not dead."
"But your eyes!"
"They've blinded my body, but not my vision," Paul said. "Ah, Stil, I live
in an apocalyptic dream. My steps fit into it so precisely that I fear most of
all I will grow bored reliving the thing so exactly."
"Usul, I don't, I don't . . ."
"Don't try to understand it. Accept it. I am in the world beyond this world
here. For me, they are the same. I need no hand to guide me. I see every
movement all around me. I see every expression of your face. I have no eyes, yet
I see."
Stilgar shook his head sharply. "Sire, we must conceal your affliction from
--"
"We hide it from no man," Paul said.
"But the law . . . "
"We live by the Atreides Law now, Stil. The Fremen Law that the blind should
be abandoned in the desert applies only to the blind. I am not blind. I live in
the cycle of being where the war of good and evil has its arena. We are at a
turning point in the succession of ages and we have our parts to play."
In a sudden stillness, Paul heard one of the wounded being led past him. "It
was terrible," the man groaned, "a great fury of fire."
"None of these men shall be taken into the desert," Paul said. "You hear me,
Stil?"
"I hear you, m'Lord."
"They are to be fitted with new eyes at my expense."
"It will be done, m'Lord."
Paul, hearing the awe grow in Stilgar's voice, said: "I will be at the
Command 'thopter. Take charge here."
"Yes, m'Lord."
Paul stepped around Stilgar, strode down the street. His vision told him
every movement, every irregularity beneath his feet, every face he encountered.
He gave orders as he moved, pointing to men of his personal entourage, calling
out names, summoning to himself the ones who represented the intimate apparatus
of government. He could feel the terror grow behind him, the fearful whispers.
"His eyes!"
"But he looked right at you, called you by name!"
At the Command 'thopter, he deactivated his personal shield, reached into
the machine and took the microphone from the hand of a startled communications
officer, issued a swift string of orders, thrust the microphone back into the
officer's hand. Turning, Paul summoned a weapons specialist, one of the eager
and brilliant new breed who remembered sietch life only dimly.
"They used a stone burner," Paul said.
After the briefest pause, the man said: "So I was told, Sire."
"You know what that means, of course."
"The fuel could only have been atomic."
Paul nodded, thinking of how this man's mind must be racing. Atomics. The
Great Convention prohibited such weapons. Discovery of the perpetrator would
bring down the combined retributive assault of the Great Houses. Old feuds would
be forgotten, discarded in the face of this threat and the ancient fears it
aroused.
"It cannot have been manufactured without leaving some traces," Paul said.
"You will assemble the proper equipment and search out the place where the stone
burner was made."
"At once, Sire." With one last fearful glance, the man sped away.
"M'Lord," the communications officer ventured from behind him. "Your eyes .
. . "
Paul turned, reached into the 'thopter, returned the command set to his
personal band. "Call Chani," he ordered. "Tell her . . . tell her I am alive and
will be with her soon."
Now the forces gather, Paul thought. And he noted how strong was the smell
of fear in the perspiration all around.

-The Moon Falls Down Songs of Muad'dib
After seven days of radiating fevered activity, the Keep took on an
unnatural quiet. On this morning, there were people about, but they spoke in
whispers, heads close together, and they walked softly. Some scurried with an
oddly furtive gait. The sight of a guard detail coming in from the forecourt
drew questioning looks and frowns at the noise which the newcomers brought with
their tramping about and stacking of weapons. The newcomers caught the mood of
the interior, though, and began moving in that furtive way.
Talk of the stone burner still floated around: "He said the fire had bluegreen in it and a smell out of hell."
"Elpa is a fool! He says he'll commit suicide rather than take Tleilaxu
eyes."
"I don't like talk of eyes."
"Muad'dib passed me and called me by name!"
"How does He see without eyes?"
"People are leaving, had you heard? There's great fear. The Naibs say
they'll go to Sietch Makab for a Grand Council."
"What've they done with the Panegyrist?"
"I saw them take him into the chamber where the Naibs are meeting. Imagine
Korba a prisoner!"
Chani had arisen early, awakened by a stillness in the Keep. Awakening,
she'd found Paul sitting beside her, his eyeless sockets aimed at some formless
place beyond the far wall of their bedchamber. What the stone burner had done
with its peculiar affinity for eye tissue, all that ruined flesh had been
removed. Injections and unguents had saved the stronger flesh around the
sockets, but she felt that the radiation had gone deeper.
Ravenous hunger seized her as she sat up. She fed on the food kept by the
bedside -- spicebread, a heavy cheese.

Paul gestured at the food. "Beloved, there was no way to spare you this.
Believe me."
Chani stilled a fit of trembling when he aimed those empty sockets at her.
She'd given up asking him to explain. He spoke so oddly: "I was baptized in sand
and it cost me the knack of believing. Who trades in faiths anymore? Who'll buy?
Who'll sell?"
What could he mean by such words?
He refused even to consider Tleilaxu eyes, although he bought them with a
lavish hand for the men who'd shared his affliction.
Hunger satisfied, Chani slipped from bed, glanced back at Paul, noted his
tiredness. Grim lines framed his mouth. The dark hair stood up, mussed from a
sleep that hadn't healed. He appeared so saturnine and remote. The back and
forth of waking and sleeping did nothing to change this. She forced herself to
turn away, whispered: "My love . . . my love . . . "
He leaned over, pulled her back into the bed, kissed her cheeks. "Soon we'll
go back to our desert," he whispered. "Only a few things remain to be done
here."
She trembled at the finality in his voice.
He tightened his arms around her, murmured: "Don't fear me, my Sihaya.
Forget mystery and accept love. There's no mystery about love. It comes from
life. Can't you feel that?"
"Yes."
She put a palm against his chest, counting his heartbeats. His love cried
out to the Fremen spirit in her -- torrential, outpouring, savage. A magnetic
power enveloped her.
"I promise you a thing, beloved," he said. "A child of ours will rule such
an empire that mine will fade in comparison. Such achievements of living and art
and sublime --"
"We're here now!" she protested, fighting a dry sob. "And . . . I feel we
have so little . . . time."
"We have eternity, beloved."
"You may have eternity. I have only now."
"But this is eternity." He stroked her forehead.
She pressed against him, lips on his neck. The pressure agitated the life in
her womb. She felt it stir.
Paul felt it, too. He put a hand on her abdomen, said: "Ahh, little ruler of
the universe, wait your time. This moment is mine."
She wondered then why he always spoke of the life within her as singular.
Hadn't the medics told him? She searched back in her own memory, curious that
the subject had never arisen between them. Surely, he must know she carried
twins. She hesitated on the point of raising this question. He must know. He
knew everything. He knew all the things that were herself. His hands, his mouth
-- all of him knew her.
Presently, she said: "Yes, love. This is forever . . . this is real." And
she closed her eyes tightly lest sight of his dark sockets stretch her soul from
paradise to hell. No matter the rihani magic in which he'd enciphered their
lives, his flesh remained real, his caresses could not be denied.
When they arose to dress for the day, she said: "If the people only knew
your love . . ."
But his mood had changed. "You can't build politics on love," he said.
"People aren't concerned with love; it's too disordered. They prefer despotism.
Too much freedom breeds chaos. We can't have that, can we? And how do you make
despotism lovable?"
"You're not a despot!" she protested, tying her scarf. "Your laws are just."
"Ahh, laws," he said. He crossed to the window, pulled back the draperies as
though he could look out. "What's law? Control? Law filters chaos and what drips
through? Serenity? Law -- our highest ideal and our basest nature. Don't look
too closely at the law. Do, and you'll find the rationalized interpretations,
the legal casuistry, the precedents of convenience. You'll find the serenity,
which is just another word for death."
Chani's mouth drew into a tight line. She couldn't deny his wisdom and
sagacity, but these moods frightened her. He turned upon himself and she sensed
internal wars. It was as though he took the Fremen maxim, "Never to forgive -never to forget," and whipped his own flesh with it.
She crossed to his side, stared past him at an angle. The growing heat of
the day had begun pulling the north wind out of these protected latitudes. The
wind painted a false sky full of ochre plumes and sheets of crystal, strange
designs in rushing gold and red. High and cold, the wind broke against the
Shield Wall with fountains of dust.
Paul felt Chani's warmth beside him. Momentarily, he lowered a curtain of
forgetfulness across his vision. He might just be standing here with his eyes
closed. Time refused to stand still for him, though. He inhaled darkness -starless, tearless. His affliction dissolved substance until all that remained
was astonishment at the way sounds condensed his universe. Everything around him
leaned on his lonely sense of hearing, falling back only when he touched
objects: the drapery, Chani's hand . . . He caught himself listening for Chani's
breaths.
Where was the insecurity of things that were only probable? he asked
himself. His mind carried such a burden of mutilated memories. For every instant
of reality there existed countless projections, things fated never to be. An
invisible self within him remembered the false pasts, their burden threatening
at times to overwhelm the present.
Chani leaned against his arm.
He felt his body through her touch: dead flesh carried by time eddies. He
reeked of memories that had glimpsed eternity. To see eternity was to be exposed
to eternity's whims, oppressed by endless dimensions. The oracle's false
immortality demanded retribution: Past and Future became simultaneous.
Once more, the vision arose from its black pit, locked onto him. It was his
eyes. It moved his muscles. It guided him into the next moment, the next hour,
the next day . . . until he felt himself to be always there!
"It's time we were going," Chani said. "The Council . . ."
"Alia will be there to stand in my place."
"Does she know what to do?"
"She knows."
Alia's day began with a guard squadron swarming into the parade yard below
her quarters. She stared down at a scene of frantic confusion, clamorous and
intimidating babble. The scene became intelligible only when she recognized the
prisoner they'd brought: Korba, the Panegyrist.
She made her morning toilet, moving occasionally to the window, keeping
watch on the progress of impatience down there. Her gaze kept straying to Korba.
She tried to remember him as the rough and bearded commander of the third wave
in the battle of Arrakeen. It was impossible. Korba had become an immaculate fop
dressed now in a Parato silk robe of exquisite cut. It lay open to the waist,
revealing a beautifully laundered ruff and embroidered undercoat set with green
gems. A purple belt gathered the waist. The sleeves poking through the robe's
armhole slits had been tailored into rivulet ridges of dark green and black
velvet.
A few Naibs had come out to observe the treatment accorded a fellow Fremen.
They'd brought on the clamor, exciting Korba to protest his innocence. Alia
moved her gaze across the Fremen faces, trying to recapture memories of the
original men. The present blotted out the past. They'd all become hedonists,
samplers of pleasures most men couldn't even imagine.
Their uneasy glances, she saw, strayed often to the doorway into the chamber
where they would meet. They were thinking of Muad'dib's blind-sight, a new
manifestation of mysterious powers. By their law, a blind man should be
abandoned in the desert, his water given up to Shai-hulud. But eyeless Muad'dib
saw them. They disliked buildings, too, and felt vulnerable in space built above
the ground. Give them a proper cave cut from rock, then they could relax -- but
not here, not with this new Muad'dib waiting inside.
As she turned to go down to the meeting, she saw the letter where she'd left
it on a table by the door: the latest message from their mother. Despite the
special reverence held for Caladan as the place of Paul's birth, the Lady
Jessica had emphasized her refusal to make her planet a stop on the hajj.
"No doubt my son is an epochal figure of history," she'd written, "but I
cannot see this as an excuse for submitting to a rabble invasion."
Alia touched the letter, experienced an odd sensation of mutual contact.
This paper had been in her mother's hands. Such an archaic device, the letter -but personal in a way no recording could achieve. Written in the Atreides Battle
Tongue, it represented an almost invulnerable privacy of communication.
Thinking of her mother afflicted Alia with the usual inward blurring. The
spice change that had mixed the psyches of mother and daughter forced her at
times to think of Paul as a son to whom she had given birth. The capsule-complex
of oneness could present her own father as a lover. Ghost shadows cavorted in
her mind, people of possibility.
Alia reviewed the letter as she walked down the ramp to the antechamber
where her guard amazons waited.
"You produce a deadly paradox," Jessica had written. "Government cannot be
religious and self-assertive at the same time. Religious experience needs a
spontaneity which laws inevitably suppress. And you cannot govern without laws.
Your laws eventually must replace morality, replace conscience, replace even the
religion by which you think to govern. Sacred ritual must spring from praise and
holy yearnings which hammer out a significant morality. Government, on the other
hand, is a cultural organism particularly attractive to doubts, questions and
contentions. I see the day coming when ceremony must take the place of faith and
symbolism replaces morality."
The smell of spice-coffee greeted Alia in the antechamber. Four guard
amazons in green watchrobes came to attention as she entered. They fell into
step behind her, striding firmly in the bravado of their youth, eyes alert for
trouble. They had zealot faces untouched by awe. They radiated that special
Fremen quality of violence: they could kill casually with no sense of guilt.
In this, I am different, Alia thought. The Atreides name has enough dirt on
it without that.
Word preceded her. A waiting page darted off as she entered the lower hall,
running to summon the full guard detail. The hall stretched out windowless and
gloomy, illuminated only by a few subdued glowglobes. Abruptly, the doors to the
parade yard opened wide at the far end to admit a glaring shaft of daylight. The
guard with Korba in their midst wavered into view from the outside with the
light behind them.
"Where is Stilgar?" Alia demanded.
"Already inside," one of her amazons said.
Alia led the way into the chamber. It was one of the Keep's more pretentious
meeting places. A high balcony with rows of soft seats occupied one side. Across
from the balcony, orange draperies had been pulled back from tall windows.
Bright sunlight poured through from an open space with a garden and a fountain.
At the near end of the chamber on her right stood a dais with a single massive
chair.
Moving to the chair, Alia glanced back and up, saw the gallery filled with
Naibs.
Household guardsmen packed the open space beneath the gallery, Stilgar
moving among them with a quiet word here, a command there. He gave no sign that
he'd seen Alia enter,
Korba was brought in, seated at a low table with cushions beside it on the
chamber floor below the dais. Despite his finery, the Panegyrist gave the
appearance now of a surly, sleepy old man huddled up in his robes as against the
outer cold. Two guardsmen took up positions behind him.
Stilgar approached the dais as Alia seated herself.
"Where is Muad'dib?" he asked.
"My brother has delegated me to preside as Reverend Mother," Alia said.
Hearing this, the Naibs in the gallery began raising their voices in
protest.
"Silence!" Alia commanded. In the abrupt quiet, she said: "Is it not Fremen
law that a Reverend Mother presides when life and death are at issue?"
As the gravity of her statement penetrated, stillness came over the Naibs,
but Alia marked angry stares across the rows of faces. She named them in her
mind for discussion in Council -- Hobars, Rajifiri, Tasmin, Saajid, Umbu, Legg .
. . The names carried pieces of Dune in them: Umbu Sietch, Tasmin Sink, Hobars
Gap . . .
She turned her attention to Korba.
Observing her attention, Korba lifted his chin, said: "I protest my
innocence."
"Stilgar, read the charges," Alia said.
Stilgar produced a brown spicepaper scroll, stepped forward. He began
reading, a solemn flourish in his voice as though to hidden rhythms. He gave the
words an incisive quality, clear and full of probity:
" . . . that you did conspire with traitors to accomplish the destruction of
our Lord and Emperor; that you did meet in vile secrecy with diverse enemies of
the realm; that you . . . "
Korba kept shaking his head with a look of pained anger.
Alia listened broodingly, chin planted on her left fist, head cocked to that
side, the other arm extended along the chair arm. Bits of the formal procedure
began dropping out of her awareness, screened by her own feelings of disquiet.
" . . . venerable tradition . . . support of the legions and all Fremen
everywhere . . . violence met with violence according to the Law . . . majesty
of the Imperial Person . . . forfeit all rights to . . ."
It was nonsense, she thought. Nonsense! All of it -- nonsense . . . nonsense
. . . nonsense . . .
Stilgar finished: "Thus the issue is brought to judgment."
In the immediate silence, Korba rocked forward, hands gripping his knees,
veined neck stretched as though he were preparing to leap. His tongue flicked
between his teeth as he spoke.
"Not by word or deed have I been traitor to my Fremen vows! I demand to
confront my accuser!"
A simple enough protest, Alia thought.
And she saw that it had produced a considerable effect on the Naibs. They
knew Korba. He was one of them. To become a Naib, he'd proved his Fremen courage
and caution. Not brilliant, Korba, but reliable. Not one to lead a Jihad,
perhaps, but a good choice as supply officer. Not a crusader, but one who
cherished the old Fremen virtues: The Tribe is paramount.
Otheym's bitter words as Paul had recited them swept through Alia's mind.
She scanned the gallery. Any of those men might see himself in Korba's place -some for good reason. But an innocent Naib was as dangerous as a guilty one
here.
Korba felt it, too. "Who accuses me?" he demanded. "I have a Fremen right to
confront my accuser."
"Perhaps you accuse yourself," Alia said.
Before he could mask it, mystical terror lay briefly on Korba's face. It was
there for anyone to read: With her powers, Alia had but to accuse him herself,
saying she brought the evidence from the shadow region, the alam al-mythal.

"Our enemies have Fremen allies," Alia pressed. "Water traps have been
destroyed, qanats blasted, plantings poisoned and storage basins plundered . .
."
"And now -- they've stolen a worm from the desert, taken it to another
world!"
The voice of this intrusion was known to all of them -- Muad'dib. Paul came
through the doorway from the hall, pressed through the guard ranks and crossed
to Alia's side. Chani, accompanying him, remained on the sidelines.
"M'Lord," Stilgar said, refusing to look at Paul's face.
Paul aimed his empty sockets at the gallery, then down to Korba. "What,
Korba -- no words of praise?"
Muttering could be heard in the gallery. It grew louder, isolated words and
phrases audible: " . . . law for the blind . . . Fremen way . . . in the desert
. . . who breaks . . ."
"Who says I'm blind?" Paul demanded. He faced the gallery. "You, Rajifiri? I
see you're wearing gold today, and that blue shirt beneath it which still has
dust on it from the streets. You always were untidy."
Rajifiri made a warding gesture, three fingers against evil.
"Point those fingers at yourself!" Paul shouted. "We know where the evil
is!" He turned back to Korba. "There's guilt on your face, Korba."
"Not my guilt! I may've associated with the guilty, but no . . . " He broke
off, shot a frightened look at the gallery.
Taking her cue from Paul, Alia arose, stepped down to the floor of the
chamber, advanced to the edge of Korba's table. From a range of less than a
meter, she stared down at him, silent and intimidating.
Korba cowered under the burden of eyes. He fidgeted, shot anxious glances at
the gallery.
"Whose eyes do you seek up there?" Paul asked.
"You cannot see!" Korba blurted.
Paul put down a momentary feeling of pity for Korba. The man lay trapped in
the vision's snare as securely as any of those present. He played a part, no
more.
"I don't need eyes to see you," Paul said. And he began describing Korba,
every movement, every twitch, every alarmed and pleading look at the gallery.
Desperation grew in Korba.
Watching him, Alia saw he might break any second. Someone in the gallery
must realize how near he was to breaking, she thought. Who? She studied the
faces of the Naibs, noting small betrayals in the masked faces . . . angers,
fears, uncertainties . . . guilts.
Paul fell silent.
Korba mustered a pitiful air of pomposity to plead: "Who accuses me?"
"Otheym accuses you," Alia said.
"But Otheym's dead!" Korba protested.
"How did you know that?" Paul asked. "Through your spy system? Oh, yes! We
know about your spies and couriers. We know who brought the stone burner here
from Tarahell."
"It was for the defense of the Qizarate!" Korba blurted.
"Is that how it got into traitorous hands?" Paul asked.
"It was stolen and we . . ." Korba fell silent, swallowed. His gaze darted
left and right. "Everyone knows I've been the voice of love for Muad'dib." He
stared at the gallery. "How can a dead man accuse a Fremen?"
"Otheym's voice isn't dead," Alia said. She stopped as Paul touched her arm.
"Otheym sent us his voice," Paul said. "It gives the names, the acts of
treachery, the meeting places and the times. Do you miss certain faces in the
Council of Naibs, Korba? Where are Merkur and Fash? Keke the Lame isn't with us
today. And Takim, where is he?"
Korba shook his head from side to side.

"They've fled Arrakis with the stolen worm," Paul said. "Even if I freed you
now, Korba, Shai-hulud would have your water for your part in this. Why don't I
free you, Korba? Think of all those men whose eyes were taken, the men who
cannot see as I see. They have families and friends, Korba. Where could you hide
from them?"
"It was an accident," Korba pleaded. "Anyway, they're getting Tleilaxu . . .
" Again, he subsided.
"Who knows what bondage goes with metal eyes?" Paul asked.
The Naibs in their gallery began exchanging whispered comments, speaking
behind raised hands. They gazed coldly at Korba now.
"Defense of the Qizarate," Paul murmured, returning to Korba's plea. "A
device which either destroys a planet or produces J-rays to blind those too near
it. Which effect, Korba, did you conceive as a defense? Does the Qizarate rely
on stopping the eyes of all observers?"
"It was a curiosity, m'Lord," Korba pleaded. "We knew the Old Law said that
only Families could possess atomics, but the Qizarate obeyed . . . obeyed . . .
"
"Obeyed you," Paul said. "A curiosity, indeed."
"Even if it's only the voice of my accuser, you must face me with it!" Korba
said. "A Fremen has rights."
"He speaks truth, Sire," Stilgar said.
Alia glanced sharply at Stilgar.
"The law is the law," Stilgar said, sensing Alia's protest. He began quoting
Fremen Law, interspersing his own comments on how the Law pertained.
Alia experienced the odd sensation she was hearing Stilgar's words before he
spoke them. How could he be this credulous? Stilgar had never appeared more
official and conservative, more intent on adhering to the Dune Code. His chin
was outthrust, aggressive. His mouth chopped. Was there really nothing in him
but this outrageous pomposity?
"Korba is a Fremen and must be judged by Fremen Law," Stilgar concluded.
Alia turned away, looked out at the day shadows dropping down the wall
across from the garden. She felt drained by frustration. They'd dragged this
thing along well into midmorning. Now, what? Korba had relaxed. The Panegyrist's
manner said he'd suffered an unjust attack, that everything he'd done had been
for love of Muad'dib. She glanced at Korba, surprised a look of sly selfimportance sliding across his face.
He might almost have received a message, she thought. He acted the part of a
man who'd heard friends shout: "Hold fast! Help is on its way!"
For an instant, they'd held this thing in their hands -- the information out
of the dwarf, the clues that others were in the plot, the names of informants.
But the critical moment had flown. Stilgar? Surely not Stilgar. She turned,
stared at the old Fremen.
Stilgar met her gaze without flinching.
"Thank you, Stil," Paul said, "for reminding us of the Law."
Stilgar inclined his head. He moved close, shaped silent words in a way he
knew both Paul and Alia could read. I'll wring him dry and then take care of the
matter.
Paul nodded, signaled the guardsmen behind Korba.
"Remove Korba to a maximum security cell," Paul said. "No visitors except
counsel. As counsel, I appoint Stilgar."
"Let me choose my own counsel!" Korba shouted.
Paul whirled. "You deny the fairness and judgment of Stilgar?"
"Oh, no, m'Lord, but . . . "
"Take him away!" Paul barked.
The guardsmen lifted Korba off the cushions, herded him out.

With new mutterings, the Naibs began quitting their gallery. Attendants came
from beneath the gallery, crossed to the windows and drew the orange draperies.
Orange gloom took over the chamber.
"Paul," Alia said.
"When we precipitate violence," Paul said, "it'll be when we have full
control of it. Thank you, Stil; you played your part well. Alia, I'm certain,
has identified the Naibs who were with him. They couldn't help giving themselves
away."
"You cooked this up between you?" Alia demanded.
"Had I ordered Korba slain out of hand, the Naibs would have understood,"
Paul said. "But this formal procedure without strict adherence to Fremen Law -they felt their own rights threatened. Which Naibs were with him, Alia?"
"Rajifiri for certain," she said, voice low. "And Saajid, but . . . "
"Give Stilgar the complete list," Paul said.
Alia swallowed in a dry throat, sharing the general fear of Paul in this
moment. She knew how he moved among them without eyes, but the delicacy of it
daunted her. To see their forms in the air of his vision! She sensed her person
shimmering for him in a sidereal time whose accord with reality depended
entirely on his words and actions. He held them all in the palm of his vision!
"It's past time for your morning audience, Sire," Stilgar said. "Many people
-- curious . . . afraid . . ."
"Are you afraid, Stil?"
It was barely a whisper: "Yes."
"You're my friend and have nothing to fear from me," Paul said.
Stilgar swallowed. "Yes, m'Lord."
"Alia, take the morning audience," Paul said. "Stilgar, give the signal."
Stilgar obeyed.
A flurry of movement erupted at the great doors. A crowd was pressed back
from the shadowy room to permit entrance of officials. Many things began
happening all at once: the household guard elbowing and shoving back the press
of Supplicants, garishly robed Pleaders trying to break through, shouts, curses.
Pleaders waved the papers of their calling. The Clerk of the Assemblage strode
ahead of them through the opening cleared by the guard. He carried the List of
Preferences, those who'd be permitted to approach the Throne. The Clerk, a wiry
Fremen named Tecrube, carried himself with weary cynicism, flaunting his shaven
head, clumped whiskers.
Alia moved to intercept him, giving Paul time to slip away with Chani
through the private passage behind the dais. She experienced a momentary
distrust of Tecrube at the prying curiosity in the stare he sent after Paul.
"I speak for my brother today," she said. "Have the Supplicants approach one
at a time."
"Yes, m'Lady." He turned to arrange his throng.
"I can remember a time when you wouldn't have mistaken your brother's
purpose here," Stilgar said.
"I was distracted," she said. "There's been a dramatic change in you, Stil.
What is it?"
Stilgar drew himself up, shocked. One changed, of course. But dramatically?
This was a particular view of himself that he'd never encountered. Drama was a
questionable thing. Imported entertainers of dubious loyalty and more dubious
virtue were dramatic. Enemies of the Empire employed drama in their attempts to
sway the fickle populace. Korba had slipped away from Fremen virtues to employ
drama for the Qizarate. And he'd die for that.
"You're being perverse," Stilgar said. "Do you distrust me?"
The distress in his voice softened her expression, but not her tone. "You
know I don't distrust you. I've always agreed with my brother that once matters
were in Stilgar's hands we could safely forget them."
"Then why do you say I've . . . changed?"
"You're preparing to disobey my brother," she said. "I can read it in you. I
only hope it doesn't destroy you both."
The first of the Pleaders and Supplicants were approaching now. She turned
away before Stilgar could respond. His face, though, was filled with the things
she'd sensed in her mother's letter -- the replacement of morality and
conscience with law.
"You produce a deadly paradox."

"You are Bijaz," the ghola said, entering the small chamber where the dwarf
was held under guard. "I am called Hayt."
A strong contingent of the household guard had come in with the ghola to
take over the evening watch. Sand carried by the sunset wind had stung their
cheeks while they crossed the outer yard, made them blink and hurry. They could
be heard in the passage outside now exchanging the banter and ritual of their
tasks.
"You are not Hayt," the dwarf said. "You are Duncan Idaho. I was there when
they put your dead flesh into the tank and I was there when they removed it,
alive and ready for training."
The ghola swallowed in a throat suddenly dry. The bright glowglobes of the
chamber lost their yellowness in the room's green hangings. The light showed
beads of perspiration on the dwarf's forehead. Bijaz seemed a creature of odd
integrity, as though the purpose fashioned into him by the Tleilaxu were
projected out through his skin. There was power beneath the dwarf's mask of
cowardice and frivolity.
"Muad'dib has charged me to question you to determine what it is the
Tleilaxu intend you to do here," Hayt said.
"Tleilaxu, Tleilaxu," the dwarf sang. "I am the Tleilaxu, you dolt! For that
matter, so are you."
Hayt stared at the dwarf. Bijaz radiated a charismatic alertness that made
the observer think of ancient idols.
"You hear that guard outside?" Hayt asked. "If I gave them the order, they'd
strangle you."
"Hai! Hai!" Bijaz cried. "What a callous lout you've become. And you said
you came seeking truth."
Hayt found he didn't like the look of secret repose beneath the dwarf's
expression. "Perhaps I only seek the future," he said.
"Well spoken," Bijaz said. "Now we know each other. When two thieves meet
they need no introduction."
"So we're thieves," Hayt said. "What do we steal?"
"Not thieves, but dice," Bijaz said. "And you came here to read my spots. I,
in turn, read yours. And lo! You have two faces!"
"Did you really see me go into the Tleilaxu tanks?" Hayt asked, fighting an
odd reluctance to ask that question.
"Did I not say it?" Bijaz demanded. The dwarf bounced to his feet. "We had a
terrific struggle with you. The flesh did not want to come back."
Hayt felt suddenly that he existed in a dream controlled by some other mind,
and that he might momentarily forget this to become lost in the convolutions of
that mind.

Bijaz tipped his head slyly to one side, walked all around the ghola,
staring up at him. "Excitement kindles old patterns in you," Bijaz said. "You
are the pursuer who doesn't want to find what he pursues."
"You're a weapon aimed at Muad'dib," Hayt said, swiveling to follow the
dwarf. "What is it you're to do?"
"Nothing!" Bijaz said, stopping. "I give you a common answer to a common
question."
"Then you were aimed at Alia," Hayt said. "Is she your target?"
"They call her Hawt, the Fish Monster, on the out-worlds," Bijaz said. "How
is it I hear your blood boiling when you speak of her?"
"So they call her Hawt," the ghola said, studying Bijaz for any clue to his
purpose. The dwarf made such odd responses.
"She is the virgin-harlot," Bijaz said. "She is vulgar, witty, knowledgeable
to a depth that terrifies, cruel when she is most kind, unthinking while she
thinks, and when she seeks to build she is as destructive as a coriolis storm."
"So you came here to speak out against Alia," Hayt said.
"Against her?" Bijaz sank to a cushion against the wall. "I came here to be
captured by the magnetism of her physical beauty." He grinned, a saurian
expression in the big-featured face.
"To attack Alia is to attack her brother," Hayt said.
"That is so clear it is difficult to see," Bijaz said. "In truth, Emperor
and sister are one person back to back, one being half male and half female."
"That is a thing we've heard said by the Fremen of the deep desert," Hayt
said. "And those are the ones who've revived the blood sacrifice to Shai-hulud.
How is it you repeat their nonsense?"
"You dare say nonsense?" Bijaz demanded. "You, who are both man and mask?
Ahh, but the dice cannot read their own spots. I forget this. And you are doubly
confused because you serve the Atreides double-being. Your senses are not as
close to the answer as your mind is."
"Do you preach that false ritual about Muad'dib to your guards?" Hayt asked,
his voice low. He felt his mind being tangled by the dwarf's words.
"They preach to me!" Bijaz said. "And they pray. Why should they not? All of
us should pray. Do we not live in the shadow of the most dangerous creation the
universe has ever seen?"
"Dangerous creation . . ."
"Their own mother refuses to live on the same planet with them!"
"Why don't you answer me straight out?" Hayt demanded. "You know we have
other ways of questioning you. We'll get our answers . . . one way or another."
"But I have answered you! Have I not said the myth is real? Am I the wind
that carries death in its belly? No! I am words! Such words as the lightning
which strikes from the sand in a dark sky. I have said: 'Blow out the lamp! Day
is here!' And you keep saying: 'Give me a lamp so I can find the day.' "
"You play a dangerous game with me," Hayt said. "Did you think I could not
understand these Zensunni ideas? You leave tracks as clear as those of a bird in
mud."
Bijaz began to giggle.
"Why do you laugh?" Hayt demanded.
"Because I have teeth and wish I had not," Bijaz managed between giggles.
"Having no teeth, I could not gnash them."
"And now I know your target," Hayt said. "You were aimed at me."
"And I've hit it right on!" Bijaz said. "You made such a big target, how
could I miss?" He nodded as though to himself. "Now I will sing to you." He
began to hum, a keening, whining monotonous theme, repeated over and over.
Hayt stiffened, experiencing odd pains that played up and down his spine. He
stared at the face of the dwarf, seeing youthful eyes in an old face. The eyes
were the center of a network of knobby white lines which ran to the hollows
below his temples. Such a large head! Every feature focused on the pursed-up
mouth from which that monotonous noise issued. The sound made Hayt think of
ancient rituals, folk memories, old words and customs, half-forgotten meanings
in lost mutterings. Something vital was happening here -- a bloody play of ideas
across Time. Elder ideas lay tangled in the dwarfs singing. It was like a
blazing light in the distance, coming nearer and nearer, illuminating life
across a span of centuries.
"What are you doing to me?" Hayt gasped.
"You are the instrument I was taught to play," Bijaz said. "I am playing
you. Let me tell you the names of the other traitors among the Naibs. They are
Bikouros and Cahueit. There is Djedida, who was secretary to Korba. There is
Abumojandis, the aide to Bannerjee. Even now, one of them could be sinking a
blade into your Muad'dib."
Hayt shook his head from side to side. He found it too difficult to talk.
"We are like brothers," Bijaz said, interrupting his monotonous hum once
more. "We grew in the same tank: I first and then you."
Hayt's metal eyes inflicted him with a sudden burning pain. Flickering red
haze surrounded everything he saw. He felt he had been cut away from every
immediate sense except the pain, and he experienced his surroundings through a
thin separation like windblown gauze. All had become accident, the chance
involvement of inanimate matter. His own will was no more than a subtle,
shifting thing. It lived without breath and was intelligible only as an inward
illumination.
With a clarity born of desperation, he broke through the gauze curtain with
the lonely sense of sight. His attention focused like a blazing light under
Bijaz. Hayt felt that his eyes cut through layers of the dwarf, seeing the
little man as a hired intellect, and beneath that, a creature imprisoned by
hungers and cravings which lay huddled in the eyes -- layer after layer, until
finally, there was only an entity-aspect being manipulated by symbols.
"We are upon a battleground," Bijaz said. "You may speak of it."
His voice freed by the command, Hayt said: "You cannot force me to slay
Muad'dib."
"I have heard the Bene Gesserit say," Bijaz said, "that there is nothing
firm, nothing balanced, nothing durable in all the universe -- that nothing
remains in its state, that each day, sometimes each hour, brings change."
Hayt shook his head dumbly from side to side.
"You believed the silly Emperor was the prize we sought," Bijaz said. "How
little you understand our masters, the Tleilaxu. The Guild and Bene Gesserit
believe we produce artifacts. In reality, we produce tools and services.
Anything can be a tool -- poverty, war. War is useful because it is effective in
so many areas. It stimulates the metabolism. It enforces government. It diffuses
genetic strains. It possesses a vitality such as nothing else in the universe.
Only those who recognize the value of war and exercise it have any degree of
self-determination."
In an oddly placid voice, Hayt said: "Strange thoughts coming from you,
almost enough to make me believe in a vengeful Providence. What restitution was
exacted to create you? It would make a fascinating story, doubtless with an even
more extraordinary epilogue."
"Magnificent!" Bijaz chortled. "You attack -- therefore you have willpower
and exercise self-determination."
"You're trying to awaken violence in me," Hayt said in a panting voice.
Bijaz denied this with a shake of the head. "Awaken, yes; violence, no. You
are a disciple of awareness by training, so you have said. I have an awareness
to awaken in you, Duncan Idaho."
"Hayt!"
"Duncan Idaho. Killer extraordinary. Lover of many women. Swordsman soldier.
Atreides field hand on the field of battle. Duncan Idaho."
"The past cannot be awakened."
"Cannot?"
"It has never been done!"
"True, but our masters defy the idea that something cannot be done. Always,
they seek the proper tool, the right application of effort, the services of the
proper --"
"You hide your real purpose! You throw up a screen of words and they mean
nothing!"
"There is a Duncan Idaho in you," Bijaz said. "It will submit to emotion or
to dispassionate examination, but submit it will. This awareness will rise
through a screen of suppression and selection out of the dark past which dogs
your footsteps. It goads you even now while it holds you back. There exists that
being within you upon which awareness must focus and which you will obey."
"The Tleilaxu think I'm still their slave, but I --"
"Quiet, slave!" Bijaz said in that whining voice.
Hayt found himself frozen in silence.
"Now we are down to bedrock," Bijaz said. "I know you feel it. And these are
the power-words to manipulate you . . . I think they will have sufficient
leverage."
Hayt felt the perspiration pouring down his cheeks, the trembling of his
chest and arms, but he was powerless to move.
"One day," Bijaz said, "the Emperor will come to you. He will say: 'She is
gone.' The grief mask will occupy his face. He will give water to the dead, as
they call their tears hereabouts. And you will say, using my voice: 'Master! Oh,
Master!' "
Hayt's jaw and throat ached with the locking of his muscles. He could only
twist his head in a brief arc from side to side.
"You will say, 'I carry a message from Bijaz.' " The dwarf grimaced. "Poor
Bijaz, who has no mind . . . poor Bijaz, a drum stuffed with messages, an
essence for others to use . . . pound on Bijaz and he produces a noise . . . "
Again, he grimaced. "You think me a hypocrite. Duncan Idaho! I am not! I can
grieve, too. But the time has come to substitute swords for words."
A hiccup shook Hayt.
Bijaz giggled, then: "Ah, thank you, Duncan, thank you. The demands of the
body save us. As the Emperor carries the blood of the Harkonnens in his veins,
he will do as we demand. He will turn into a spitting machine, a biter of words
that ring with a lovely noise to our masters."
Hayt blinked, thinking how the dwarf appeared like an alert little animal, a
thing of spite and rare intelligence. Harkonnen blood in the Atreides?
"You think of Beast Rabban, the vile Harkonnen, and you glare," Bijaz said.
"You are like the Fremen in this. When words fail, the sword is always at hand,
eh? You think of the torture inflicted upon your family by the Harkonnens. And,
through his mother, your precious Paul is a Harkonnen! You would not find it
difficult to slay a Harkonnen, now would you?"
Bitter frustration coursed through the ghola. Was it anger? Why should this
cause anger?
"Ohhh," Bijaz said, and: "Ahhhh, hah! Click-click. There is more to the
message. It is a trade the Tleilaxu offer your precious Paul Atreides. Our
masters will restore his beloved. A sister to yourself -- another ghola."
Hayt felt suddenly that he existed in a universe occupied only by his own
heartbeats.
"A ghola," Bijaz said. "It will be the flesh of his beloved. She will bear
his children. She will love only him. We can even improve on the original if he
so desires. Did ever a man have greater opportunity to regain what he'd lost? It
is a bargain he will leap to strike."
Bijaz nodded, eyes drooping as though tiring. Then: "He will be tempted . .
. and in his distraction, you will move close. In the instant, you will strike!

Two gholas, not one! That is what our masters demand!" The dwarf cleared his
throat, nodded once more, said: "Speak."
"I will not do it," Hayt said.
"But Duncan Idaho would," Bijaz said. "It will be the moment of supreme
vulnerability for this descendant of the Harkonnens. Do not forget this. You
will suggest improvements to his beloved -- perhaps a deathless heart, gentler
emotions. You will offer asylum as you move close to him -- a planet of his
choice somewhere beyond the Imperium. Think of it! His beloved restored. No more
need for tears, and a place of idyls to live out his years."
"A costly package," Hayt said, probing. "He'll ask the price."
"Tell him he must renounce his godhead and discredit The Qizarate. He must
discredit himself, his sister."
"Nothing more?" Hayt asked, sneering.
"He must relinquish his CHOAM holdings, naturally."
"Naturally."
"And if you're not yet close enough to strike, speak of how much the
Tleilaxu admire what he has taught them about the possibilities of religion.
Tell him the Tleilaxu have a department of religious engineering, shaping
religions to particular needs."
"How very clever," Hayt said.
"You think yourself free to sneer and disobey me," Bijaz said. He cocked his
head slyly to one side. "Don't deny it . . ."
"They made you well, little animal," Hayt said.
"And you as well," the dwarf said. "You will tell him to hurry. Flesh decays
and her flesh must be preserved in a cryological tank."
Hayt felt himself floundering, caught in a matrix of objects he could not
recognize. The dwarf appeared so sure of himself! There had to be a flaw in the
Tleilaxu logic. In making their ghola, they'd keyed him to the voice of Bijaz,
but . . . But what? Logic/matrix/object . . . How easy it was to mistake clear
reasoning for correct reasoning! Was Tleilaxu logic distorted?
Bijaz smiled, listened as though to a hidden voice. "Now, you will forget,"
he said. "When the moment comes, you will remember. He will say: 'She is gone.'
Duncan Idaho will awaken then."
The dwarf clapped his hands together.
Hayt grunted, feeling that he had been interrupted in the middle of a
thought . . . or perhaps in the middle of a sentence. What was it? Something
about . . . targets?
"You think to confuse me and manipulate me," he said.
"How is that?" Bijaz asked.
"I am your target and you can't deny it," Hayt said.
"I would not think of denying it."
"What is it you'd try to do with me?"
"A kindness," Bijaz said. "A simple kindness."

The sequential nature of actual events is not illuminated with lengthy precision
by the powers of prescience except under the most extraordinary circumstances.
The oracle grasps incidents cut out of the historic chain. Eternity moves. It
inflicts itself upon the oracle and the supplicant alike. Let Muad'dib's
subjects doubt his majesty and his oracular visions. Let them deny his powers.
Let them never doubt Eternity.
-The Dune Gospels
Hayt watched Alia emerge from her temple and cross the plaza. Her guard was
bunched close, fierce expressions on their faces to mask the lines molded by
good living and complacency.

A heliograph of 'thopter wings flashed in the bright afternoon sun above the
temple, part of the Royal Guard with Muad'dib's fist-symbol on its fuselage.
Hayt returned his gaze to Alia. She looked out of place here in the city, he
thought. Her proper setting was the desert -- open, untrammeled space. An odd
thing about her came back to him as he watched her approach: Alia appeared
thoughtful only when she smiled. It was a trick of the eyes, he decided,
recalling a cameo memory of her as she'd appeared at the reception for the Guild
Ambassador: haughty against a background of music and brittle conversation among
extravagant gowns and uniforms. And Alia had been wearing white, dazzling, a
bright garment of chastity. He had looked down upon her from a window as she
crossed an inner garden with its formal pond, its fluting fountains, fronds of
pampas grass and a white belvedere.
Entirely wrong . . . all wrong. She belonged in the desert.
Hayt drew in a ragged breath. Alia had moved out of his view then as she did
now. He waited, clenching and unclenching his fists. The interview with Bijaz
had left him uneasy.
He heard Alia's entourage pass outside the room where he waited. She went
into the Family quarters.
Now he tried to focus on the thing about her which troubled him. The way
she'd walked across the plaza? Yes. She'd moved like a hunted creature fleeing
some predator. He stepped out onto the connecting balcony, walked along it
behind the plasmeld sunscreen, stopped while still in concealing shadows. Alia
stood at the balustrade overlooking her temple.
He looked where she was looking -- out over the city. He saw rectangles,
blocks of color, creeping movements of life and sound. Structures gleamed,
shimmered. Heat patterns spiraled off the rooftops. There was a boy across the
way bouncing a ball in a cul-de-sac formed by a buttressed massif at a corner of
the temple. Back and forth the ball went.
Alia, too, watched the ball. She felt a compelling identity with that ball - back and forth . . . back and forth. She sensed herself bouncing through
corridors of Time.
The potion of melange she'd drained just before leaving the temple was the
largest she'd ever attempted -- a massive overdose. Even before beginning to
take effect, it had terrified her.
Why did I do it? she asked herself.
"One made a choice between dangers." Was that it? This was the way to
penetrate the fog spread over the future by that damnable Dune Tarot. A barrier
existed. It must be breached. She had acted out of a necessity to see where it
was her brother walked with his eyeless stride.
The familiar melange fugue state began creeping into her awareness. She took
a deep breath, experienced a brittle form of calm, poised and selfless.
Possession of second sight has a tendency to make one a dangerous fatalist,
she thought. Unfortunately, there existed no abstract leverage, no calculus of
prescience. Visions of the future could not be manipulated as formulas. One had
to enter them, risking life and sanity.
A figure moved from the harsh shadows of the adjoining balcony. The ghola!
In her heightened awareness, Alia saw him with intense clarity -- the dark,
lively features dominated by those glistening metal eyes. He was a union of
terrifying opposites, something put together in a shocking linear way. He was
shadow and blazing light, a product of the process which had revived his dead
flesh . . . and of something intensely pure . . . innocent.
He was innocence under siege!
"Have you been there all along, Duncan?" she asked.
"So I'm to be Duncan," he said. "Why?"
"Don't question me," she said.
And she thought, looking at him, that the Tleilaxu had left no corner of
their ghola unfinished.

"Only gods can safely risk perfection," she said. "It's a dangerous thing
for a man."
"Duncan died," he said, wishing she would not call him that. "I am Hayt."
She studied his artificial eyes, wondering what they saw. Observed closely,
they betrayed tiny black pockmarks, little wells of darkness in the glittering
metal. Facets! The universe shimmered around her and lurched. She steadied
herself with a hand on the sun-warmed surface of the balustrade. Ahhh, the
melange moved swiftly.
"Are you ill?" Hayt asked. He moved closer, the steely eyes opened wide,
staring.
Who spoke? she wondered. Was it Duncan Idaho? Was it the mentat-ghola or the
Zensunni philosopher? Or was it a Tleilaxu pawn more dangerous than any Guild
Steersman? Her brother knew.
Again, she looked at the ghola. There was something inactive about him now,
a latent something. He was saturated with waiting and with powers beyond their
common life.
"Out of my mother, I am like the Bene Gesserit," she said. "Do you know
that?"
"I know it."
"I use their powers, think as they think. Part of me knows the sacred
urgency of the breeding program . . . and its products."
She blinked, feeling part of her awareness begin to move freely in Time.
"It's said that the Bene Gesserit never let go," he said. And he watched her
closely, noting how white her knuckles were where she gripped the edge of the
balcony.
"Have I stumbled?" she asked.
He marked how deeply she breathed, with tension in every movement, the
glazed appearance of her eyes.
"When you stumble," he said, "you may regain your balance by jumping beyond
the thing that tripped you."
"The Bene Gesserit stumbled," she said. "Now they wish to regain their
balance by leaping beyond my brother. They want Chani's baby . . . or mine."
"Are you with child?"
She struggled to fix herself in a timespace relationship to this question.
With child? When? Where?
"I see . . . my child," she whispered.
She moved away from the balcony's edge, turned her head to look at the
ghola. He had a face of salt, bitter eyes -- two circles of glistening lead . .
. and, as he turned away from the light to follow her movement, blue shadows.
"What . . . do you see with such eyes?" she whispered.
"What other eyes see," he said.
His words rang in her ears, stretching her awareness. She felt that she
reached across the universe -- such a stretching . . . out . . . out. She lay
intertwined with all Time.
"You've taken the spice, a large dose," he said.
"Why can't I see him?" she muttered. The womb of all creation held her
captive. "Tell me, Duncan, why I cannot see him."
"Who can't you see?"
"I cannot see the father of my children. I'm lost in a Tarot fog. Help me."
Mentat logic offered its prime computation, and he said: "The Bene Gesserit
want a mating between you and your brother. It would lock the genetic . . . "
A wail escaped her. "The egg in the flesh," she gasped. A sensation of chill
swept over her, followed by intense heat. The unseen mate of her darkest dreams!
Flesh of her flesh that the oracle could not reveal -- would it come to that?
"Have you risked a dangerous dose of the spice?" he asked. Something within
him fought to express the utmost terror at the thought that an Atreides woman
might die, that Paul might face him with the knowledge that a female of the
royal family had . . . gone.
"You don't know what it's like to hunt the future," she said. "Sometimes I
glimpse myself . . . but I get in my own way. I cannot see through myself." She
lowered her head, shook it from side to side.
"How much of the spice did you take?" he asked.
"Nature abhors prescience," she said, raising her head. "Did you know that,
Duncan?"
He spoke softly, reasonably, as to a small child: "Tell me how much of the
spice you took." He took hold of her shoulder with his left hand.
"Words are such gross machinery, so primitive and ambiguous," she said. She
pulled away from his hand.
"You must tell me," he said.
"Look at the Shield Wall," she commanded, pointing. She sent her gaze along
her own outstretched hand, trembled as the landscape crumbled in an overwhelming
vision -- a sandcastle destroyed by invisible waves. She averted her eyes, was
transfixed by the appearance of the ghola's face. His features crawled, became
aged, then young . . . aged . . . young. He was life itself, assertive, endless
. . . She turned to flee, but he grabbed her left wrist.
"I am going to summon a doctor," he said.
"No! You must let me have the vision! I have to know!"
"You are going inside now," he said.
She stared down at his hand. Where their flesh touched, she felt an electric
presence that both lured and frightened her. She jerked free, gasped: "You can't
hold the whirlwind!"
"You must have medical help!" he snapped.
"Don't you understand?" she demanded. "My vision's incomplete, just
fragments. It flickers and jumps. I have to remember the future. Can't you see
that?"
"What is the future if you die?" he asked, forcing her gently into the
Family chambers.
"Words . . . words," she muttered. "I can't explain it. One thing is the
occasion of another thing, but there's no cause . . . no effect. We can't leave
the universe as it was. Try as we may, there's a gap."
"Stretch out here," he commanded.
He is so dense! she thought.
Cool shadows enveloped her. She felt her own muscles crawling like worms -a firm bed that she knew to be insubstantial. Only space was permanent. Nothing
else had substance. The bed flowed with many bodies, all of them her own. Time
became a multiple sensation, overloaded. It presented no single reaction for her
to abstract. It was Time. It moved. The whole universe slipped backward,
forward, sideways.
"It has no thing-aspect," she explained. "You can't get under it or around
it. There's no place to get leverage."
There came a fluttering of people all around her. Many someones held her
left hand. She looked at her own moving flesh, followed a twining arm out to a
fluid mask of face: Duncan Idaho! His eyes were . . . wrong, but it was Duncan - child-man-adolescent-child-man-adolescent . . . Every line of his features
betrayed concern for her.
"Duncan, don't be afraid," she whispered.
He squeezed her hand, nodded. "Be still," he said.
And he thought: She must not die! She must not! No Atreides woman can die!
He shook his head sharply. Such thoughts defied mentat logic. Death was a
necessity that life might continue.
The ghola loves me, Alia thought.

The thought became bedrock to which she might cling. He was a familiar face
with a solid room behind him. She recognized one of the bedrooms in Paul's
suite.
A fixed, immutable person did something with a tube in her throat. She
fought against retching.
"We got her in time," a voice said, and she recognized the tones of a Family
medic. "You should've called me sooner." There was suspicion in the medic's
voice. She felt the tube slide out of her throat -- a snake, a shimmering cord.
"The slapshot will make her sleep," the medic said. "I'll send one of her
attendants to --"
"I will stay with her," the ghola said.
"That is not seemly!" the medic snapped.
"Stay . . . Duncan," Alia whispered.
He stroked her hand to tell her he'd heard.
"M'Lady," the medic said, "it'd be better if . . ."
"You do not tell me what is best," she rasped. Her throat ached with each
syllable.
"M'Lady," the medic said, voice accusing, "you know the dangers of consuming
too much melange. I can only assume someone gave it to you without --"
"You are a fool," she rasped. "Would you deny me my visions? I knew what I
took and why." She put a hand to her throat. "Leave us. At once!"
The medic pulled out of her field of vision, said: "I will send word to your
brother."
She felt him leave, turned her attention to the ghola. The vision lay
clearly in her awareness now, a culture medium in which the present grew
outward. She sensed the ghola move in that play of Time, no longer cryptic,
fixed now against a recognizable background.
He is the crucible, she thought. He is danger and salvation.
And she shuddered, knowing she saw the vision of her brother had seen.
Unwanted tears burned her eyes. She shook her head sharply. No tears! They
wasted moisture and, worse, distracted the harsh flow of vision. Paul must be
stopped! Once, just once, she had bridged Time to place her voice where he would
pass. But stress and mutability would not permit that here. The web of Time
passed through her brother now like rays of light through a lens. He stood at
the focus and he knew it. He had gathered all the lines to himself and would not
permit them to escape or change.
"Why?" she muttered. "Is it hate? Does he strike out at Time itself because
it hurt him? Is that it . . . hate?"
Thinking he heard her speak his name, the ghola said: "M'Lady?"
"If I could only burn this thing out of me!" she cried. "I didn't want to be
different."
"Please, Alia," he murmured. "Let yourself sleep."
"I wanted to be able to laugh," she whispered. Tears slid down her cheeks.
"But I'm sister to an Emperor who's worshipped as a god. People fear me. I never
wanted to be feared."
He wiped the tears from her face.
"I don't want to be part of history," she whispered. "I just want to be
loved . . . and to love."
"You are loved," he said.
"Ahhh, loyal, loyal Duncan," she said.
"Please, don't call me that," he pleaded.
"But you are," she said. "And loyalty is a valued commodity. It can be sold
. . . not bought, but sold."
"I don't like your cynicism," he said.
"Damn your logic! It's true!"
"Sleep," he said.
"Do you love me, Duncan?" she asked.

"Yes."
"Is that one of those lies," she asked, "one of the lies that are easier to
believe than the truth? Why am I afraid to believe you?"
"You fear my differences as you fear your own."
"Be a man, not a mentat!" she snarled.
"I am a mentat and a man."
"Will you make me your woman, then?"
"I will do what love demands."
"And loyalty?"
"And loyalty."
"That's where you're dangerous," she said.
Her words disturbed him. No sign of the disturbance arose to his face, no
muscle trembled -- but she knew it. Vision-memory exposed the disturbance. She
felt she had missed part of the vision, though, that she should remember
something else from the future. There existed another perception which did not
go precisely by the senses, a thing which fell into her head from nowhere the
way prescience did. It lay in the Time shadows -- infinitely painful.
Emotion! That was it -- emotion! It had appeared in the vision, not
directly, but as a product from which she could infer what lay behind. She had
been possessed by emotion -- a single constriction made up of fear, grief and
love. They lay there in the vision, all collected into a single epidemic body,
overpowering and primordial.
"Duncan, don't let me go," she whispered.
"Sleep," he said. "Don't fight it."
"I must . . . I must. He's the bait in his own trap. He's the servant of
power and terror. Violence . . . deification is a prison enclosing him. He'll
lose . . . everything. It'll tear him apart."
"You speak of Paul?"
"They drive him to destroy himself," she gasped, arching her back. "Too much
weight, too much grief. They seduce him away from love." She sank back to the
bed. "They're creating a universe where he won't permit himself to live."
"Who is doing this?"
"He is! Ohhh, you're so dense. He's part of the pattern. And it's too late .
. . too late . . . too late . . ."
As she spoke, she felt her awareness descend, layer by layer. It came to
rest directly behind her navel. Body and mind separated and merged in a
storehouse of relic visions -- moving, moving . . . She heard a fetal heartbeat,
a child of the future. The melange still possessed her, then, setting her adrift
in Time. She knew she had tasted the life of a child not yet conceived. One
thing certain about this child -- it would suffer the same awakening she had
suffered. It would be an aware, thinking entity before birth.

There exists a limit to the force even the most powerful may apply without
destroying themselves. Judging this limit is the true artistry of government.
Misuse of power is the fatal sin. The law cannot be a tool of vengeance, never a
hostage, nor a fortification against the martyrs it has created. You cannot
threaten any individual and escape the consequences.
-Muad'dib on Law, The Stilgar Commentary
Chani stared out at the morning desert framed in the fault cleft below
Sietch Tabr. She wore no stillsuit, and this made her feel unprotected here in
the desert. The sietch grotto's entrance lay hidden in the buttressed cliff
above and behind her.

The desert . . . the desert . . . She felt that the desert had followed her
wherever she had gone. Coming back to the desert was not so much a homecoming as
a turning around to see what had always been there.
A painful constriction surged through her abdomen. The birth would be soon.
She fought down the pain, wanting this moment alone with her desert.
Dawn stillness gripped the land. Shadows fled among the dunes and terraces
of the Shield Wall all around. Daylight lunged over the high scarp and plunged
her up to her eyes in a bleak landscape stretching beneath a washed blue sky.
The scene matched the feeling of dreadful cynicism which had tormented her since
the moment she'd learned of Paul's blindness.
Why are we here? she wondered.
It was not a hajra, a journey of seeking. Paul sought nothing here except,
perhaps, a place for her to give birth. He had summoned odd companions for this
journey, she thought -- Bijaz, the Tleilaxu dwarf; the ghola, Hayt, who might be
Duncan Idaho's revenant; Edric, the Guild Steersman-Ambassador; Gaius Helen
Mohiam, the Bene Gesserit Reverend Mother he so obviously hated; Lichna,
Otheym's strange daughter, who seemed unable to move beyond the watchful eyes of
guards; Stilgar, her uncle of the Naibs, and his favorite wife, Harah . . . and
Irulan . . . Alia . . .
The sound of wind through the rocks accompanied her thoughts. The desert day
had become yellow on yellow, tan on tan, gray on gray.
Why such a strange mixture of companions?
"We have forgotten," Paul had said in response to her question, "that the
word 'company' originally meant traveling companions. We are a company."
"But what value are they?"
"There!" he'd said, turning his frightful sockets toward her. "We've lost
that clear, single-note of living. If it cannot be bottled, beaten, pointed or
hoarded, we give it no value."
Hurt, she'd said: "That's not what I meant."
"Ahhh, dearest one," he'd said, soothing, "we are so money-rich and so lifepoor. I am evil, obstinate, stupid . . . "
"You are not!"
"That, too, is true. But my hands are blue with time. I think . . . I think
I tried to invent life, not realizing it'd already been invented."
And he'd touched her abdomen to feel the new life there.
Remembering, she placed both hands over her abdomen and trembled, sorry that
she'd asked Paul to bring her here.
The desert wind had stirred up evil odors from the fringe plantings which
anchored the dunes at the cliff base. Fremen superstition gripped her: evil
odors, evil times. She faced into the wind, saw a worm appear outside the
plantings. It arose like the prow of a demon ship out of the dunes, threshed
sand, smelled the water deadly to its kind, and fled beneath a long, burrowing
mound.
She hated the water then, inspired by the worm's fear. Water, once the
spirit-soul of Arrakis, had become a poison. Water brought pestilence. Only the
desert was clean.
Below her, a Fremen work gang appeared. They climbed to the sietch's middle
entrance, and she saw that they had muddy feet.
Fremen with muddy feet!
The children of the sietch began singing to the morning above her, their
voices piping from the upper entrance. The voices made her feel time fleeing
from her like hawks before the wind. She shuddered.
What storms did Paul see with his eyeless vision?
She sensed a vicious madman in him, someone weary of songs and polemics.
The sky, she noted, had become crystal gray filled with alabaster rays,
bizarre designs etched across the heavens by windborne sand. A line of gleaming
white in the south caught her attention. Eves suddenly alerted, she interpreted
the sign: White sky in the south: Shai-hulud's mouth. A storm came, big wind.
She felt the warning breeze, a crystal blowing of sand against her cheeks. The
incense of death came on the wind: odors of water flowing in qanats, sweating
sand, flint. The water -- that was why Shai-hulud sent his coriolis wind.
Hawks appeared in the cleft where she stood, seeking safety from the wind.
They were brown as the rocks and with scarlet in their wings. She felt her
spirit go out to them: they had a place to hide; she had none.
"M'Lady, the wind comes!"
She turned, saw the ghola calling to her outside the upper entrance to the
sietch. Fremen fears gripped her. Clean death and the body's water claimed for
the tribe, these she understood. But . . . something brought back from death . .
.
Windblown sand whipped at her, reddened her cheeks. She glanced over her
shoulder at the frightful band of dust across the sky. The desert beneath the
storm had taken on a tawny, restless appearance as though dune waves beat on a
tempest shore the way Paul had once described a sea. She hesitated, caught by a
feeling of the desert's transience. Measured against eternity, this was no more
than a caldron. Dune surf thundered against cliffs.
The storm out there had become a universal thing for her -- all the animals
hiding from it . . . nothing left of the desert but its own private sounds:
blown sand scraping along rock, a wind-surge whistling, the gallop of a boulder
tumbled suddenly from its hill -- then! somewhere out of sight, a capsized worm
thumping its idiot way aright and slithering off to its dry depths.
It was only a moment as her life measured time, but in that moment she felt
this planet being swept away -- cosmic dust, part of other waves.
"We must hurry," the ghola said from right beside her.
She sensed fear in him then, concern for her safety.
"It'll shred the flesh from your bones," he said, as though he needed to
explain such a storm to her.
Her fear of him dispelled by his obvious concern, Chani allowed the ghola to
help her up the rock stairway to the sietch. They entered the twisting baffle
which protected the entrance. Attendants opened the moisture seals, closed them
behind.
Sietch odors assaulted her nostrils. The place was a ferment of nasal
memories -- the warren closeness of bodies, rank esters of the reclamation
stills, familiar food aromas, the flinty burning of machines at work . . . and
through it all, the omnipresent spice: melange everywhere.
She took a deep breath. "Home."
The ghola took his hand from her arm, stood aside, a patient figure now,
almost as though turned off when not in use. Yet . . . he watched.
Chani hesitated in the entrance chamber, puzzled by something she could not
name. This was truly her home. As a child, she'd hunted scorpions here by
glowglobe light. Something was changed, though . . .
"Shouldn't you be going to your quarters, m'Lady?" the ghola asked.
As though ignited by his words, a rippling birth constriction seized her
abdomen. She fought against revealing it.
"M'Lady?" the ghola said.
"Why is Paul afraid for me to bear our children?" she asked.
"It is a natural thing to fear for your safety," the ghola said.
She put a hand to her cheek where the sand had reddened it. "And he doesn't
fear for the children?"
"M'Lady, he cannot think of a child without remembering that your firstborn
was slain by the Sardaukar."
She studied the ghola -- flat face, unreadable mechanical eyes. Was he truly
Duncan Idaho, this creature? Was he friend to anyone? Had he spoken truthfully
now?
"You should be with the medics," the ghola said.

Again, she heard the fear for her safety in his voice. She felt abruptly
that her mind lay undefended, ready to be invaded by shocking perceptions.
"Hayt, I'm afraid," she whispered. "Where is my Usul?"
"Affairs of state detain him," the ghola said.
She nodded, thinking of the government apparatus which had accompanied them
in a great flight of ornithopters. Abruptly, she realized what puzzled her about
the sietch: outworld odors. The clerks and aides had brought their own perfumes
into this environment, aromas of diet and clothing, of exotic toiletries. They
were an undercurrent of odors here.
Chani shook herself, concealing an urge to bitter laughter. Even the smells
changed in Muad'dib's presence!
"There were pressing matters which he could not defer," the ghola said,
misreading her hesitation.
"Yes . . . yes, I understand. I came with that swarm, too."
Recalling the flight from Arrakeen, she admitted to herself now that she had
not expected to survive it. Paul had insisted on piloting his own 'thopter.
Eyeless, he had guided the machine here. After that experience, she knew nothing
he did could surprise her.
Another pain fanned out through her abdomen.
The ghola saw her indrawn breath, the tightening of her cheeks, said: "Is it
your time?"
"I . . . yes, it is."
"You must not delay," he said. He grasped her arm, hurried her down the
hall.
She sensed panic in him, said: "There's time."
He seemed not to hear. "The Zensunni approach to birth," he said, urging her
even faster, "is to wait without purpose in the state of highest tension. Do not
compete with what is happening. To compete is to prepare for failure. Do not be
trapped by the need to achieve anything. This way, you achieve everything."
While he spoke, they reached the entrance to her quarters. He thrust her
through the hangings, cried out: "Harah! Harah! It is Chani's time. Summon the
medics!"
His call brought attendants running. There was a great bustling of people in
which Chani felt herself an isolated island of calm . . . until the next pain
came.
Hayt, dismissed to the outer passage, took time to wonder at his own
actions. He felt fixated at some point of time where all truths were only
temporary. Panic lay beneath his actions, he realized. Panic centered not on the
possibility that Chani might die, but that Paul should come to him afterward . .
. filled with grief . . . his loved one . . . gone . . . gone . . .
Something cannot emerge from nothing, the ghola told himself. From what does
this panic emerge?
He felt that his mentat faculties had been dulled, let out a long,
shuddering breath. A psychic shadow passed over him. In the emotional darkness
of it, he felt himself waiting for some absolute sound -- the snap of a branch
in a jungle.
A sigh shook him. Danger had passed without striking.
Slowly, marshaling his powers, shedding bits of inhibition, he sank into
mentat awareness. He forced it -- not the best way -- but somehow necessary.
Ghost shadows moved within him in place of people. He was a transshipping
station for every datum he had ever encountered. His being was inhabited by
creatures of possibility. They passed in review to be compared, judged.
Perspiration broke out on his forehead.
Thoughts with fuzzy edges feathered away into darkness -- unknown. Infinite
systems! A mentat could not function without realizing he worked in infinite
systems. Fixed knowledge could not surround the infinite. Everywhere could not
be brought into finite perspective. Instead, he must become the infinite -momentarily.
In one gestalten spasm, he had it, seeing Bijaz seated before him blazing
from some inner fire.
Bijaz!
The dwarf had done something to him!
Hayt felt himself teetering on the lip of a deadly pit. He projected the
mentat computation line forward, seeing what could develop out of his own
actions.
"A compulsion!" he gasped. "I've been rigged with a compulsion!"
A blue-robed courier, passing as Hayt spoke, hesitated. "Did you say
something, sirra?"
Not looking at him, the ghola nodded. "I said everything."

There was a man so wise,
He jumped into
A sandy place
And burnt out both his eyes!
And when he knew his eyes were gone,
He offered no complaint.
He summoned up a vision
And made himself a saint.
-Children's Verse from History of Muad'dib
Paul stood in darkness outside the sietch. Oracular vision told him it was
night, that moonlight silhouetted the shrine atop Chin Rock high on his left.
This was a memory-saturated place, his first sietch, where he and Chani . . .
I must not think of Chani, he told himself.
The thinning cup of his vision told him of changes all around -- a cluster
of palms far down to the right, the black-silver line of a qanat carrying water
through the dunes piled up by that morning's storm.
Water flowing in the desert! He recalled another kind of water flowing in a
river of his birthworld, Caladan. He hadn't realized then the treasure of such a
flow, even the murky slithering in a qanat across a desert basin. Treasure.
With a delicate cough, an aide came up from behind.
Paul held out his hands for a magnabord with a single sheet of metallic
paper on it. He moved as sluggishly as the qanat's water. The vision flowed, but
he found himself increasingly reluctant to move with it.
"Pardon, Sire," the aide said. "The Semboule Treaty -- your signature?"
"I can read it!" Paul snapped. He scrawled "Atreides Imper." in the proper
place, returned the board, thrusting it directly into the aide's outstretched
hand, aware of the fear this inspired.
The man fled.
Paul turned away. Ugly, barren land! He imagined it sun-soaked and monstrous
with heat, a place of sandslides and the drowned darkness of dust pools,
blowdevils unreeling tiny dunes across the rocks, their narrow bellies full of
ochre crystals. But it was a rich land, too: big, exploding out of narrow places
with vistas of storm-trodden emptiness, rampart cliffs and tumbledown ridges.
All it required was water . . . and love.
Life changed those irascible wastes into shapes of grace and movement, he
thought. That was the message of the desert. Contrast stunned him with
realization. He wanted to turn to the aides massed in the sietch entrance, shout
at them: If you need something to worship, then worship life -- all life, every
last crawling bit of it! We're all in this beauty together!

They wouldn't understand. In the desert, they were endlessly desert. Growing
things performed no green ballet for them.
He clenched his fists at his sides, trying to halt the vision. He wanted to
flee from his own mind. It was a beast come to devour him! Awareness lay in him,
sodden, heavy with all the living it had sponged up, saturated with too many
experiences.
Desperately, Paul squeezed his thoughts outward.
Stars!
Awareness turned over at the thought of all those stars above him -- an
infinite volume. A man must be half mad to imagine he could rule even a teardrop
of that volume. He couldn't begin to imagine the number of subjects his Imperium
claimed.
Subjects? Worshippers and enemies, more likely. Did any among them see
beyond rigid beliefs? Where was one man who'd escaped the narrow destiny of his
prejudices? Not even an Emperor escaped. He'd lived a 'take everything' life,
tried to create a universe in his own image. But the exultant universe was
breaking across him at last with its silent waves.
I spit on Dune! he thought. I give it my moisture!
This myth he'd made out of intricate movements and imagination, out of
moonlight and love, out of prayers older than Adam, and gray cliffs and crimson
shadows, laments and rivers of martyrs -- what had it come to at last? When the
waves receded, the shores of Time would spread out there clean, empty, shining
with infinite grains of memory and little else. Was this the golden genesis of
man?
Sand scuffed against rocks told him that the ghola had joined him.
"You've been avoiding me today, Duncan," Paul said.
"It's dangerous for you to call me that," the ghola said.
"I know."
"I . . . came to warn you, m'Lord."
"I know."
The story of the compulsion Bijaz had put on him poured from the ghola then.
"Do you know the nature of the compulsion?" Paul asked.
"Violence."
Paul felt himself arriving at a place which had claimed him from the
beginning. He stood suspended. The Jihad had seized him, fixed him onto a
glidepath from which the terrible gravity of the Future would never release him.
"There'll be no violence from Duncan," Paul whispered.
"But, Sire . . . "
"Tell me what you see around us," Paul said.
"M'Lord?"
"The desert -- how is it tonight?"
"Don't you see it?"
"I have no eyes, Duncan."
"But . . . "
"I've only my vision," Paul said, "and wish I didn't have it. I'm dying of
prescience, did you know that, Duncan?"
"Perhaps . . . what you fear won't happen," the ghola said.
"What? Deny my own oracle? How can I when I've seen it fulfilled thousands
of time? People call it a power, a gift. It's an affliction! It won't let me
leave my life where I found it!"
"M'Lord," the ghola muttered, "I . . . it isn't . . . young master, you
don't . . . I . . . " He fell silent.
Paul sensed the ghola's confusion, said: "What'd you call me, Duncan?"
"What? What I . . . for a moment . . ."
"You called me 'young master.' "
"I did, yes."
"That's what Duncan always called me." Paul reached out, touched the ghola's
face. "Was that part of your Tleilaxu training?"
"No."
Paul lowered his hand. "What, then?"
"It came from . . . me."
"Do you serve two masters?"
"Perhaps."
"Free yourself from the ghola, Duncan."
"How?"
"You're human. Do a human thing."
"I'm a ghola!"
"But your flesh is human. Duncan's in there."
"Something's in there."
"I care not how you do it," Paul said, "but you'll do it."
"You've foreknowledge?"
"Foreknowledge be damned!" Paul turned away. His vision hurtled forward now,
gaps in it, but it wasn't a thing to be stopped.
"M'Lord, if you've --"
"Quiet!" Paul held up a hand. "Did you hear that?"
"Hear what, m'Lord?"
Paul shook his head. Duncan hadn't heard it. Had he only imagined the sound?
It'd been his tribal name called from the desert -- far away and low: "Usul . .
. Uuuussssuuuullll . . . "
"What is it, m'Lord?"
Paul shook his head. He felt watched. Something out there in the night
shadows knew he was here. Something? No -- someone.
"It was mostly sweet," he whispered, "and you were the sweetest of all."
"What'd you say, m'Lord?"
"It's the future," Paul said.
That amorphous human universe out there had undergone a spurt of motion,
dancing to the tune of his vision. It had struck a powerful note then. The
ghost-echoes might endure.
"I don't understand, m'Lord," the ghola said.
"A Fremen dies when he's too long from the desert," Paul said. "They call it
the 'water sickness.' Isn't that odd?"
"That's very odd."
Paul strained at memories, tried to recall the sound of Chani breathing
beside him in the night. Where is there comfort? he wondered. All he could
remember was Chani at breakfast the day they'd left for the desert. She'd been
restless, irritable.
"Why do you wear that old jacket?" she'd demanded, eyeing the black uniform
coat with its red hawk crest beneath his Fremen robes. "You're an Emperor!"
"Even an Emperor has his favorite clothing," he'd said.
For no reason he could explain, this had brought real tears to Chani's eyes
-- the second time in her life when Fremen inhibitions had been shattered.
Now, in the darkness, Paul rubbed his own cheeks, felt moisture there. Who
gives moisture to the dead? he wondered. It was his own face, yet not his. The
wind chilled the wet skin. A frail dream formed, broke. What was this swelling
in his breast? Was it something he'd eaten? How bitter and plaintive was this
other self, giving moisture to the dead. The wind bristled with sand. The skin,
dry now, was his own. But whose was the quivering which remained?
They heard the wailing then, far away in the sietch depths. It grew louder .
. . louder . . .
The ghola whirled at a sudden glare of light, someone flinging wide the
entrance seals. In the light, he saw a man with a raffish grin -- no! Not a
grin, but a grimace of grief! It was a Fedaykin lieutenant named Tandis. Behind
him came a press of many people, all fallen silent now that they saw Muad'dib.

"Chani . . ." Tandis said.
"Is dead," Paul whispered. "I heard her call."
He turned toward the sietch. He knew this place. It was a place where he
could not hide. His onrushing vision illuminated the entire Fremen mob. He saw
Tandis, felt the Fedaykin's grief, the fear and anger.
"She is gone," Paul said.
The ghola heard the words out of a blazing corona. They burned his chest,
his backbone, the sockets of his metal eyes. He felt his right hand move toward
the knife at his belt. His own thinking became strange, disjointed. He was a
puppet held fast by strings reaching down from that awful corona. He moved to
another's commands, to another's desires. The strings jerked his arms, his legs,
his jaw. Sounds came squeezing out of his mouth, a terrifying repetitive noise "Hrrak! Hraak! Hraak!"
The knife came up to strike. In that instant, he grabbed his own voice,
shaped rasping words: "Run! Young master, run!"
"We will not run," Paul said. "We'll move with dignity. We'll do what must
be done."
The ghola's muscles locked. He shuddered, swayed.
" . . . what must be done!" The words rolled in his mind like a great fish
surfacing. " . . . what must be done!" Ahhh, that had sounded like the old Duke,
Paul's grandfather. The young master had some of the old man in him. " . . .
what must be done!"
The words began to unfold in the ghola's consciousness. A sensation of
living two lives simultaneously spread out through his awareness:
Hayt/Idaho/Hayt/Idaho . . . He became a motionless chain of relative existence,
singular, alone. Old memories flooded his mind. He marked them, adjusted them to
new understandings, made a beginning at the integration of a new awareness. A
new persona achieved a temporary form of internal tyranny. The masculating
synthesis remained charged with potential disorder, but events pressed him to
the temporary adjustment. The young master needed him.
It was done then. He knew himself as Duncan Idaho, remembering everything of
Hayt as though it had been stored secretly in him and ignited by a flaming
catalyst. The corona dissolved. He shed the Tleilaxu compulsions.
"Stay close to me, Duncan," Paul said. "I'll need to depend on you for many
things." And, as Idaho continued to stand entranced: "Duncan!"
"Yes, I am Duncan."
"Of course you are! This was the moment when you came back. We'll go inside
now."
Idaho fell into step beside Paul. It was like the old times, yet not like
them. Now that he stood free of the Tleilaxu, he could appreciate what they had
given him. Zensunni training permitted him to overcome the shock of events. The
mentat accomplishment formed a counterbalance. He put off all fear, standing
above the source. His entire consciousness looked outward from a position of
infinite wonder: he had, been dead; he was alive.
"Sire," the Fedaykin Tandis said as they approached him, "the woman, Lichna,
says she must see you. I told her to wait."
"Thank you," Paul said. "The birth . . . "
"I spoke to the medics," Tandis said, falling into step. "They said you have
two children, both of them alive and sound."
"Two?" Paul stumbled, caught himself on Idaho's arm.
"A boy and a girl," Tandis said. "I saw them. They're good Fremen babies."
"How . . . how did she die?" Paul whispered.
"M'Lord?" Tandis bent close.
"Chani?" Paul said.
"It was the birth, m'Lord," Tandis husked. "They said her body was drained
by the speed of it. I don't understand, but that is what they said."
"Take me to her," Paul whispered.
"M'Lord?"
"Take me to her!"
"That's where we're going, m'Lord." Again, Tandis bent close to Paul. "Why
does your ghola carry a bared knife?"
"Duncan, put away your knife," Paul said. "The time for violence is past."
As he spoke, Paul felt closer to the sound of his voice than to the
mechanism which had created the sound. Two babies! The vision had contained but
one. Yet, these moments went as the vision went. There was a person here who
felt grief and anger. Someone. His own awareness lay in the grip of an awful
treadmill, replaying his life from memory.
Two babies?
Again he stumbled. Chani, Chani, he thought. There was no other way. Chani,
beloved, believe me that this death was quicker for you . . . and kinder. They'd
have held our children hostage, displayed you in a cage and slave pits, reviled
you with the blame for my death. This way . . . this way we destroy them and
save our children.
Children?
Once more, he stumbled.
I permitted this, he thought. I should feel guilty.
The sound of noisy confusion filled the cavern ahead of them. It grew louder
precisely as he remembered it growing louder. Yes, this was the pattern, the
inexorable pattern, even with two children.
Chani is dead, he told himself.
At some faraway instant in a past which he had shared with others, this
future had reached down to him. It had chivvied him and herded him into a chasm
whose walls grew narrower and narrower. He could feel them closing in on him.
This was the way the vision went.
Chani is dead. I should abandon myself to grief.
But that was not the way the vision went.
"Has Alia been summoned?" he asked.
"She is with Chani's friends," Tandis said.
Paul sensed the mob pressing back to give him passage. Their silence moved
ahead of him like a wave. The noisy confusion began dying down. A sense of
congested emotion filled the sietch. He wanted to remove the people from his
vision, found it impossible. Every face turning to follow him carried its
special imprint. They were pitiless with curiosity, those faces. They felt
grief, yes, but he understood the cruelty which drenched them. They were
watching the articulate become dumb, the wise become a fool. Didn't the clown
always appeal to cruelty?
This was more than a deathwatch, less than a wake.
Paul felt his soul begging for respite, but still the vision moved him. Just
a little farther now, he told himself. Black, visionless dark awaited him just
ahead. There lay the place ripped out of the vision by grief and guilt, the
place where the moon fell.
He stumbled into it, would've fallen had Idaho not taken his arm in a fierce
grip, a solid presence knowing how to share his grief in silence.
"Here is the place," Tandis said.
"Watch your step, Sire," Idaho said, helping him over an entrance lip.
Hangings brushed Paul's face. Idaho pulled him to a halt. Paul felt the room
then, a reflection against his cheeks and ears. It was a rock-walled space with
the rock hidden behind tapestries.
"Where is Chani?" Paul whispered.
Harah's voice answered him: "She is right here, Usul."
Paul heaved a trembling sigh. He had feared her body already had been
removed to the stills where Fremen reclaimed the water of the tribe. Was that
the way the vision went? He felt abandoned in his blindness.

"The children?" Paul asked.
"They are here, too, m'Lord," Idaho said.
"You have beautiful twins, Usul," Harah said, "a boy and a girl. See? We
have them here in a creche."
Two children, Paul thought wonderingly. The vision had contained only a
daughter. He cast himself adrift from Idaho's arm, moved toward the place where
Harah had spoken, stumbled into a hard surface. His hands explored it: the
metaglass outlines of a creche.
Someone took his left arm. "Usul?" It was Harah. She guided his hand into
the creche. He felt soft-soft flesh. It was so warm! He felt ribs, breathing.
"That is your son," Harah whispered. She moved his hand. "And this is your
daughter." Her hand tightened on his. "Usul, are you truly blind now?"
He knew what she was thinking. The blind must be abandoned in the desert.
Fremen tribes carried no dead weight.
"Take me to Chani," Paul said, ignoring her question.
Harah turned him, guided him to the left.
Paul felt himself accepting now the fact that Chani was dead. He had taken
his place in a universe he did not want, wearing flesh that did not fit. Every
breath he drew bruised his emotions. Two children! He wondered if he had
committed himself to a passage where his vision would never return. It seemed
unimportant.
"Where is my brother?"
It was Alia's voice behind him. He heard the rush of her, the overwhelming
presence as she took his arm from Harah.
"I must speak to you!" Alia hissed.
"In a moment," Paul said.
"Now! It's about Lichna."
"I know," Paul said. "In a moment."
"You don't have a moment!"
"I have many moments."
"But Chani doesn't!"
"Be still!" he ordered. "Chani is dead." He put a hand across her mouth as
she started to protest. "I order you to be still!" He felt her subside and
removed his hand. "Describe what you see," he said.
"Paul!" Frustration and tears battled in her voice.
"Never mind," he said. And he forced himself to inner stillness, opened the
eyes of his vision to this moment. Yes -- it was still here. Chani's body lay on
a pallet within a ring of light. Someone had straightened her white robe,
smoothed it trying to hide the blood from the birth. No matter; he could not
turn his awareness from the vision of her face: such a mirror of eternity in the
still features!
He turned away, but the vision moved with him. She was gone . . . never to
return. The air, the universe, all vacant -- everywhere vacant. Was this the
essence of his penance? he wondered. He wanted tears, but they would not come.
Had he lived too long a Fremen? This death demanded its moisture!
Nearby, a baby cried and was hushed. The sound pulled a curtain on his
vision. Paul welcomed the darkness. This is another world, he thought. Two
children.
The thought came out of some lost oracular trance. He tried to recapture the
timeless mind-dilation of the melange, but awareness fell short. No burst of the
future came into this new consciousness. He felt himself rejecting the future -any future.
"Goodbye, my Sihaya," he whispered.
Alia's voice, harsh and demanding, came from somewhere behind him. "I've
brought Lichna!"
Paul turned. "That's not Lichna," he said. "That's a Face Dancer. Lichna's
dead."
"But hear what she says," Alia said.
Slowly, Paul moved toward his sister's voice.
"I'm not surprised to find you alive, Atreides." The voice was like
Lichna's, but with subtle differences, as though the speaker used Lichna's vocal
cords, but no longer bothered to control them sufficiently. Paul found himself
struck by an odd note of honesty in the voice.
"Not surprised?" Paul asked.
"I am Scytale, a Tleilaxu of the Face Dancers, and I would know a thing
before we bargain. Is that a ghola I see behind you, or Duncan Idaho?"
"It's Duncan Idaho," Paul said. "And I will not bargain with you."
"I think you'll bargain," Scytale said.
"Duncan," Paul said, speaking over his shoulder, "will you kill this
Tleilaxu if I ask it?"
"Yes, m'Lord." There was the suppressed rage of a berserker in Idaho's
voice.
"Wait!" Alia said. "You don't know what you're rejecting."
"But I do know," Paul said.
"So it's truly Duncan Idaho of the Atreides," Scytale said. "We found the
lever! A ghola can regain his past." Paul heard footsteps. Someone brushed past
him on the left. Scytale's voice came from behind him now. "What do you remember
of your past, Duncan?"
"Everything. From my childhood on. I even remember you at the tank when they
removed me from it," Idaho said.
"Wonderful," Scytale breathed. "Wonderful."
Paul heard the voice moving. I need a vision, he thought. Darkness
frustrated him. Bene Gesserit training warned him of terrifying menace in
Scytale, yet the creature remained a voice, a shadow of movement -- entirely
beyond him.
"Are these the Atreides babies?" Scytale asked.
"Harah!" Paul cried. "Get her away from there!"
"Stay where you are!" Scytale shouted. "All of you! I warn you, a Face
Dancer can move faster than you suspect. My knife can have both these lives
before you touch me."
Paul felt someone touch his right arm, then move off to the right.
"That's far enough, Alia," Scytale said.
"Alia," Paul said. "Don't."
"It's my fault," Alia groaned. "My fault!"
"Atreides," Scytale said, "shall we bargain now?"
Behind him, Paul heard a single hoarse curse. His throat constricted at the
suppressed violence in Idaho's voice. Idaho must not break! Scytale would kill
the babies!
"To strike a bargain, one requires a thing to sell," Scytale said. "Not so,
Atreides? Will you have your Chani back? We can restore her to you. A ghola,
Atreides. A ghola with full memory! But we must hurry. Call your friends to
bring a cryologic tank to preserve the flesh."
To hear Chani's voice once more, Paul thought. To feel her presence beside
me. Ahhh, that's why they gave me Idaho as a ghola, to let me discover how much
the re-creation is like the original. But now -- full restoration . . . at their
price. I'd be a Tleilaxu tool forevermore. And Chani . . . chained to the same
fate by a threat to our children, exposed once more to the Qizarate's plotting .
. .
"What pressures would you use to restore Chani's memory to her?" Paul asked,
fighting to keep his voice calm. "Would you condition her to . . . to kill one
of her own children?"
"We use whatever pressures we need," Scytale said. "What say you, Atreides?"
"Alia," Paul said, "bargain with this thing. I cannot bargain with what I
cannot see."
"A wise choice," Scytale gloated. "Well, Alia, what do you offer me as your
brother's agent?"
Paul lowered his head, bringing himself to stillness within stillness. He'd
glimpsed something just then -- like a vision, but not a vision. It had been a
knife close to him. There!
"Give me a moment to think," Alia said.
"My knife is patient," Scytale said, "but Chani's flesh is not. Take a
reasonable amount of time."
Paul felt himself blinking. It could not be . . . but it was! He felt eyes!
Their vantage point was odd and they moved in an erratic way. There! The knife
swam into his view. With a breath-stilling shock, Paul recognized the viewpoint.
It was that of one of his children! He was seeing Scytale's knife hand from
within the creche! It glittered only inches from him. Yes -- and he could see
himself across the room, as well -- head down, standing quietly, a figure of no
menace, ignored by the others in this room.
"To begin, you might assign us all your CHOAM holdings," Scytale suggested.
"All of them?" Alia protested.
"All."
Watching himself through the eyes in the creche, Paul slipped his crysknife
from its belt sheath. The movement produced a strange sensation of duality. He
measured the distance, the angle. There'd be no second chance. He prepared his
body then in the Bene Gesserit way, armed himself like a cocked spring for a
single concentrated movement, a prajna thing requiring all his muscles balanced
in one exquisite unity.
The crysknife leaped from his hand. The milky blur of it flashed into
Scytale's right eye, jerked the Face Dancer's head back. Scytale threw both
hands up and staggered backward against the wall. His knife clattered off the
ceiling, to hit the floor. Scytale rebounded from the wall; he fell face
forward, dead before he touched the floor.
Still through the eyes in the creche, Paul watched the faces in the room
turn toward his eyeless figure, read the combined shock. Then Alia rushed to the
creche, bent over it and hid the view from him.
"Oh, they're safe," Alia said. "They're safe."
"M'Lord," Idaho whispered, "was that part of your vision?"
"No." He waved a hand in Idaho's direction. "Let it be."
"Forgive me, Paul," Alia said. "But when that creature said they could . . .
revive . . . "
"There are some prices an Atreides cannot pay," Paul said. "You know that."
"I know," she sighed. "But I was tempted . . . "
"Who was not tempted?" Paul asked.
He turned away from them, groped his way to a wall, leaned against it and
tried to understand what he had done. How? How? The eyes in the creche! He felt
poised on the brink of terrifying revelation.
"My eyes, father."
The word-shapings shimmered before his sightless vision.
"My son!" Paul whispered, too low for any to hear. "You're . . . aware."
"Yes, father. Look!"
Paul sagged against the wall in a spasm of dizziness. He felt that he'd been
upended and drained. His own life whipped past him. He saw his father. He was
his father. And the grandfather, and the grandfathers before that. His awareness
tumbled through a mind-shattering corridor of his whole male line.
"How?" he asked silently.
Faint word-shapings appeared, faded and were gone, as though the strain was
too great. Paul wiped saliva from the corner of his mouth. He remembered the
awakening of Alia in the Lady Jessica's womb. But there had been no Water of
Life, no overdose of melange this time . . . or had there? Had Chani's hunger
been for that? Or was this somehow the genetic product of his line, foreseen by
the Reverend Mother Gaius Helen Mohiam?
Paul felt himself in the creche then, with Alia cooing over him. Her hands
soothed him. Her face loomed, a giant thing directly over him. She turned him
then and he saw his creche companion -- a girl with that bony-ribbed look of
strength which came from a desert heritage. She had a full head of tawny red
hair. As he stared, she opened her eyes. Those eyes! Chani peered out of her
eyes . . . and the Lady Jessica. A multitude peered out of those eyes.
"Look at that," Alia said. "They're staring at each other."
"Babies can't focus at this age," Harah said.
"I could," Alia said.
Slowly, Paul felt himself being disengaged from that endless awareness. He
was back at his own wailing wall then, leaning against it. Idaho shook his
shoulder gently.
"M'Lord?"
"Let my son be called Leto for my father," Paul said, straightening.
"At the time of naming," Harah said, "I will stand beside you as a friend of
the mother and give that name."
"And my daughter," Paul said. "Let her be called Ghanima."
"Usul!" Harah objected. "Ghanima's an ill-omened name."
"It saved your life," Paul said. "What matter that Alia made fun of you with
that name? My daughter is Ghanima, a spoil of war."
Paul heard wheels squeak behind him then -- the pallet with Chani's body
being moved. The chant of the Water Rite began.
"Hal yawm!" Harah said. "I must leave now if I am to be the observer of the
holy truth and stand beside my friend for the last time. Her water belongs to
the tribe."
"Her water belongs to the tribe," Paul murmured. He heard Harah leave. He
groped outward and found Idaho's sleeve. "Take me to my quarters, Duncan."
Inside his quarters, he shook himself free gently. It was a time to be
alone. But before Idaho could leave there was a disturbance at the door.
"Master!" It was Bijaz calling from the doorway.
"Duncan," Paul said, "let him come two paces forward. Kill him if he comes
farther."
"Ayyah," Idaho said.
"Duncan is it?" Bijaz asked. "Is it truly Duncan Idaho?"
"It is," Idaho said. "I remember."
"Then Scytale's plan succeeded!"
"Scytale is dead," Paul said.
"But I am not and the plan is not," Bijaz said. "By the tank in which I
grew! It can be done! I shall have my pasts -- all of them. It needs only the
right trigger."
"Trigger?" Paul asked.
"The compulsion to kill you," Idaho said, rage thick in his voice. "Mentat
computation: They found that I thought of you as the son I never had. Rather
than slay you, the true Duncan Idaho would take over the ghola body. But . . .
it might have failed. Tell me, dwarf, if your plan had failed, if I'd killed
him, what then?"
"Oh . . . then we'd have bargained with the sister to save her brother. But
this way the bargaining is better."
Paul took a shuddering breath. He could hear the mourners moving down the
last passage now toward the deep rooms and the water stills.
"It's not too late, m'Lord," Bijaz said. "Will you have your love back? We
can restore her to you. A ghola, yes. But now -- we hold out the full
restoration. Shall we summon servants with a cryological tank, preserve the
flesh of your beloved . . . "
It was harder now, Paul found. He had exhausted his powers in the first
Tleilaxu temptation. And now all that was for nothing! To feel Chani's presence
once more . . .
"Silence him," Paul told Idaho, speaking in Atreides battle tongue. He heard
Idaho move toward the door.
"Master!" Bijaz squeaked.
"As you love me," Paul said, still in battle tongue, "do me this favor: Kill
him before I succumb!"
"Noooooo . . . " Bijaz screamed.
The sound stopped abruptly with a frightened grunt.
"I did him the kindness," Idaho said.
Paul bent his head, listening. He no longer could hear the mourners. He
thought of the ancient Fremen rite being performed now deep in the sietch, far
down in the room of the death-still where the tribe recovered its water.
"There was no choice," Paul said. "You understand that, Duncan?"
"I understand."
"There are some things no one can bear. I meddled in all the possible
futures I could create until, finally, they created me."
"M'Lord, you shouldn't . . ."
"There are problems in this universe for which there are no answers," Paul
said. "Nothing. Nothing can be done."
As he spoke, Paul felt his link with the vision shatter. His mind cowered,
overwhelmed by infinite possibilities. His lost vision became like the wind,

We say of Muad'dib that he has gone on a journey into that land where we walk
without footprints.
-Preamble to the Qizarate Creed
There was a dike of water against the sand, an outer limit for the plantings
of the sietch holding. A rock bridge came next and then the open desert beneath
Idaho's feet. The promontory of Sietch Tabr dominated the night sky behind him.
The light of both moons frosted its high rim. An orchard had been brought right
down to the water.
Idaho paused on the desert side and stared back at flowered branches over
silent water -- reflections and reality -- four moons. The stillsuit felt greasy
against his skin. Wet flint odors invaded his nostrils past the filters. There
was a malignant simpering to the wind through the orchard. He listened for night
sounds. Kangaroo mice inhabited the grass at the water verge; a hawk owl bounced
its droning call into the cliff shadows; the wind-broken hiss of a sandfall came
from the open bled.
Idaho turned toward the sound.
He could see no movement out there on the moonlit dunes.
It was Tandis who had brought Paul this far. Then the man had returned to
tell his account. And Paul had walked out into the desert -- like a Fremen.
"He was blind -- truly blind," Tandis had said, as though that explained it.
"Before that, he had the vision which he told to us . . . but . . . "
A shrug. Blind Fremen were abandoned in the desert. Muad'dib might be
Emperor, but he was also Fremen. Had he not made provision that Fremen guard and
raise his children? He was Fremen.
It was a skeleton desert here, Idaho saw. Moon-silvered ribs of rock showed
through the sand; then the dunes began.
I should not have left him alone, not even for a minute, Idaho thought. I
knew what was in his mind.

"He told me the future no longer needed his physical presence," Tandis had
reported. "When he left me. He called back. 'Now I am free' were his words."
Damn them! Idaho thought.
The Fremen had refused to send 'thopters or searchers of any kind. Rescue
was against their ancient customs.
"There will be a worm for Muad'dib," they said. And they began the chant for
those committed to the desert, the ones whose water went to Shai-hulud: "Mother
of sand, father of Time, beginning of Life, grant him passage."
Idaho seated himself on a flat rock and stared at the desert. The night out
there was filled with camouflage patterns. There was no way to tell where Paul
had gone.
"Now I am free."
Idaho spoke the words aloud, surprised by the sound of his own voice. For a
time, he let his mind run, remembering a day when he'd taken the child Paul to
the sea market on Caladan, the dazzling glare of a sun on water, the sea's
riches brought up dead, there to be sold. Idaho remembered Gurney Halleck
playing music of the baliset for them -- pleasure, laughter. Rhythms pranced in
his awareness, leading his mind like a thrall down channels of remembered
delight.
Gurney Halleck. Gurney would blame him for this tragedy.
Memory music faded.
He recalled Paul's words: "There are problems in this universe for which
there are no answers."
Idaho began to wonder how Paul would die out there in the desert. Quickly,
killed by a worm? Slowly, in the sun? Some of the Fremen back there in the
sietch had said Muad'dib would never die, that he had entered the ruh-world
where all possible futures existed, that he would be present henceforth in the
alam al-mythal, wandering there endlessly even after his flesh had ceased to be.
He'll die and I'm powerless to prevent it, Idaho thought.
He began to realize that there might be a certain fastidious courtesy in
dying without a trace -- no remains, nothing, and an entire planet for a tomb.
Mentat, solve thyself, he thought.
Words intruded on his memory -- the ritual words of the Fedaykin lieutenant,
posting a guard over Muad'dib's children: "It shall be the solemn duty of the
officer in charge . . . "
The plodding, self-important language of government enraged him. It had
seduced the Fremen. It had seduced everyone. A man, a great man, was dying out
there, but language plodded on . . . and on . . . and on . . .
What had happened, he wondered, to all the clean meanings that screened out
nonsense? Somewhere, in some lost where which the Imperium had created, they'd
been walled off, sealed against chance rediscovery. His mind quested for
solutions, mentat fashion. Patterns of knowledge glistened there. Lorelei hair
might shimmer thus, beckoning . . . beckoning the enchanted seaman into emerald
caverns . . .
With an abrupt start, Idaho drew back from catatonic forgetfulness.
So! he thought. Rather than face my failure, I would disappear within
myself!
The instant of that almost-plunge remained in his memory. Examining it, he
felt his life stretch out as long as the existence of the universe. Real flesh
lay condensed, finite in its emerald cavern of awareness, but infinite life had
shared his being.
Idaho stood up, feeling cleansed by the desert. Sand was beginning to
chatter in the wind, pecking at the surfaces of leaves in the orchard behind
him. There was the dry and abrasive smell of dust in the night air. His robe
whipped to the pulse of a sudden gust.

Somewhere far out in the bled, Idaho realized, a mother storm raged, lifting
vortices of winding dust in hissing violence -- a giant worm of sand powerful
enough to cut flesh from bones.
He will become one with the desert, Idaho thought. The desert will fulfill
him.
It was a Zensunni thought washing through his mind like clear water. Paul
would go on marching out there, he knew. An Atreides would not give himself up
completely to destiny, not even in the full awareness of the inevitable.
A touch of prescience came over Idaho then, and he saw that people of the
future would speak of Paul in terms of seas. Despite a life soaked in dust,
water would follow him. "His flesh foundered," they would say, "but he swam on."
Behind Idaho, a man cleared his throat.
Idaho turned to discern the figure of Stilgar standing on the bridge over
the qanat.
"He will not be found," Stilgar said. "Yet all men will find him."
"The desert takes him -- and deifies him," Idaho said. "Yet he was an
interloper here. He brought an alien chemistry to this planet -- water."
"The desert imposes its own rhythms," Stilgar said. "We welcomed him, called
him our Mahdi, our Muad'dib, and gave him his secret name. Base of the Pillar:
Usul."
"Still he was not born a Fremen."
"And that does not change the fact that we claimed him . . . and have
claimed him finally." Stilgar put a hand on Idaho's shoulder. "All men are
interlopers, old friend."
"You're a deep one, aren't you, Stil?"
"Deep enough. I can see how we clutter the universe with our migrations.
Muad'dib gave us something uncluttered. Men will remember his Jihad for that, at
least."
"He won't give up to the desert," Idaho said. "He's blind, but he won't give
up. He's a man of honor and principle. He was Atreides-trained."
"And his water will be poured on the sand," Stilgar said. "Come." He pulled
gently at Idaho's arm. "Alia is back and is asking for you."
"She was with you at Sietch Makab?"
"Yes -- she helped whip those soft Naibs into line. They take her orders now
. . . as I do."
"What orders?"
"She commanded the execution of the traitors."
"Oh." Idaho suppressed a feeling of vertigo as he looked up at the
promontory. "Which traitors?"
"The Guildsman, the Reverend Mother Mohiam, Korba . . . a few others."
"You slew a Reverend Mother?"
"I did. Muad'dib left word that it should not be done." He shrugged. "But I
disobeyed him, as Alia knew I would."
Idaho stared again into the desert, feeling himself become whole, one person
capable of seeing the pattern of what Paul had created. Judgment strategy, the
Atreides called it in their training manuals. People are subordinate to
government, but the ruled influence the rulers. Did the ruled have any concept,
he wondered, of what they had helped create here?
"Alia . . . " Stilgar said, clearing his throat. He sounded embarrassed.
"She needs the comfort of your presence."
"And she is the government," Idaho murmured.
"A regency, no more."
"Fortune passes everywhere, as her father often said," Idaho muttered.
"We make our bargain with the future," Stilgar said. "Will you come now? We
need you back there." Again, he sounded embarrassed. "She is . . . distraught.
She cries out against her brother one moment, mourns him the next."
"Presently," Idaho promised. He heard Stilgar leave. He stood facing into
the rising wind, letting the grains of sand rattle against the stillsuit.
Mentat awareness projected the outflowing patterns into the future. The
possibilities dazzled him. Paul had set in motion a whirling vortex and nothing
could stand in its path.
The Bene Tleilax and the Guild had overplayed their hands and had lost, were
discredited. The Qizarate was shaken by the treason of Korba and others high
within it. And Paul's final voluntary act, his ultimate acceptance of their
customs, had ensured the loyalty of the Fremen to him and to his house. He was
one of them forever now.
"Paul is gone!" Alia's voice was choked. She had come up almost silently to
where Idaho stood and was now beside him. "He was a fool, Duncan!"
"Don't say that!" he snapped.
"The whole universe will say it before I'm through," she said.
"Why, for the love of heaven?"
"For the love of my brother, not of heaven."
Zensunni insight dilated his awareness. He could sense that there was no
vision in her -- had been none since Chani's death. "You practice an odd love,"
he said.
"Love? Duncan, he had but to step off the track! What matter that the rest
of the universe would have come shattering down behind him? He'd have been safe
. . . and Chani with him!"
"Then . . . why didn't he?"
"For the love of heaven," she whispered. Then, more loudly, she said:
"Paul's entire life was a struggle to escape his Jihad and its deification. At
least, he's free of it. He chose this!"
"Ah, yes -- the oracle." Idaho shook his head in wonder. "Even Chani's
death. His moon fell."
"He was a fool, wasn't he, Duncan?"
Idaho's throat tightened with suppressed grief.
"Such a fool!" Alia gasped her control breaking. "He'll live forever while
we must die!"
"Alia, don't . . . "
"It's just grief," she said, voice low. "Just grief. Do you know what I must
do for him? I must save the life of the Princess Irulan. That one! You should
hear her grief. Wailing, giving moisture to the dead; she swears she loved him
and knew it not. She reviles her Sisterhood, says she'll spend her life teaching
Paul's children."
"You trust her?"
"She reeks of trustworthiness!"
"Ahhh," Idaho murmured. The final pattern unreeled before his awareness like
a design on fabric. The defection of the Princess Irulan was the last step. It
left the Bene Gesserit with no remaining lever against the Atreides heirs.
Alia began to sob, leaned against him, face pressed into his chest. "Ohhh,
Duncan, Duncan! He's gone!"
Idaho put his lips against her hair. "Please," he whispered. He felt her
grief mingling with his like two streams entering the same pool.
"I need you, Duncan," she sobbed. "Love me!"
"I do," he whispered.
She lifted her head, peered at the moon-frosted outline of his face. "I
know, Duncan. Love knows love."
Her words sent a shudder through him, a feeling of estrangement from his old
self. He had come out here looking for one thing and had found another. It was
as though he'd lurched into a room full of familiar people only to realize too
late that he knew none of them.
She pushed away from him, took his hand. "Will you come with me, Duncan?"
"Wherever you lead," he said.

She led him back across the qanat into the darkness at the base of the
massif and its Place of Safety.

No bitter stench of funeral-still for Muad'dib.
No knell nor solemn rite to free the mind
From avaricious shadows.
He is the fool saint,
The golden stranger living forever
On the edge of reason.
Let your guard fall and he is there!
His crimson peace and sovereign pallor
Strike into our universe on prophetic webs
To the verge, of a quiet glance -- there!
Out of bristling star-jungles:
Mysterious, lethal, an oracle without eyes,
Catspaw of prophecy, whose voice never dies!
Shai-hulud, he awaits thee upon a strand
Where couples walk and fix, eye to eye,
The delicious ennui of love.
He strides through the long cavern of time,
Scattering the fool-self of his dream.
